# Phase 4: Worker Loader Testing - Results

**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Status:** ❌ Blocked - Worker Loader NOT available (even in local dev)

## Summary

Worker Loader is in **CLOSED BETA** and is **NOT available**, even in local development. Despite correct configuration and updated tooling, the LOADER binding is not functional.

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Updated Wrangler ✅
- From 3.114.14 → 4.42.0
- Configuration warning disappeared
- LOADER binding still not available

### 2. Fixed API Usage ✅  
- Confirmed correct API: `env.LOADER.get(id, async () => WorkerCode)`
- Matches Cloudflare documentation exactly

### 3. Fixed globalOutbound Type Error ✅
- Issue: Expected Fetcher type, was passing function
- Fix: Wrapped in `{ fetch: async (request) => {...} }`
- Type error fixed, but LOADER still not working

### 4. Comprehensive Local Testing ✅
- Tested with wrangler dev
- Added debug logging
- Confirmed LOADER.get() returns empty object

## Debug Output

```
Worker object type: object
Worker keys: []  
Worker.fetch type: undefined
Has fetch: false
```

## Root Cause

**Worker Loader requires beta access allowlist** from Cloudflare:
- Must sign up: https://forms.gle/MoeDxE9wNiqdf8ri9  
- Account needs Cloudflare to enable the feature
- Does NOT work even in local dev without access

## Current Status

**All code is ready**, waiting only for Worker Loader access:
- ✅ DO Worker architecture complete
- ✅ Outbound handler implemented (temporarily disabled)
- ✅ Authorization system complete
- ✅ Test worker ready
- ❌ Worker Loader not available

## Next Steps

1. **Verify beta access** with Cloudflare
2. **Test locally** - LOADER binding must appear in `wrangler dev`
3. **Re-enable globalOutbound** once LOADER works
4. **Deploy and test** full integration

**Recommendation:** Do NOT proceed until Worker Loader is confirmed working in local dev.
