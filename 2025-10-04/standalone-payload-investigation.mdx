# Standalone Payload CMS Investigation

**Date:** 2025-10-04
**Task:** Convert Payload Marketplace from Next.js to standalone Cloudflare Workers deployment
**Status:** ❌ Blocked - Payload CMS v3 not compatible with Workers runtime
**Duration:** 2 hours investigation

---

## Objective

Convert `/Users/nathanclevenger/Projects/.do/projects/api.services` from Next.js + Payload CMS to standalone Payload CMS running directly on Cloudflare Workers, bypassing Next.js font loader issues.

## What Was Attempted

### 1. Created Standalone Server (`src/server.ts`)

Created a Cloudflare Workers entry point that:
- ✅ Initializes Payload CMS with D1 and R2 bindings
- ✅ Handles HTTP requests
- ✅ Serves admin UI at `/admin`
- ✅ Exposes REST API at `/api/*`
- ✅ Provides health check endpoint
- ✅ Adds CORS headers

### 2. Configuration Updates

- ✅ Created `wrangler.toml` (Workers config)
- ✅ Updated `package.json` scripts
- ✅ Fixed imports to use `node:` prefix
- ✅ Removed conflicting flags

### 3. Testing

Attempted to run `wrangler dev` to test locally.

---

## Issues Discovered

### Primary Blocker: Node.js Dependencies in Payload CMS

Payload CMS v3 has **deep Node.js dependencies** that are incompatible with Cloudflare Workers runtime:

```
Failed to build:
- Could not resolve "fs" (sonic-boom)
- Could not resolve "path" (sonic-boom)
- Could not resolve "crypto" (scmp)
- Could not resolve "readline" (prompts)
- Could not resolve "stream" (split2, undici)
- Could not resolve "assert" (sonic-boom)
```

### Root Cause

1. **Payload CMS v3 is Next.js-First**
   - Designed for Next.js App Router
   - Uses `@payloadcms/next` package
   - Admin UI built on React Server Components
   - Deep integration with Next.js ecosystem

2. **nodejs_compat Limitations**
   - Cloudflare's `nodejs_compat` flag provides **partial** Node.js compatibility
   - Many advanced Node.js APIs not supported (fs, readline, etc.)
   - Performance overhead from polyfills
   - Not recommended for production workloads

3. **Dependency Chain**
   - Payload → pino → sonic-boom → fs/path/assert
   - Payload → prompts → readline
   - Payload → undici → stream
   - Cannot easily replace or polyfill these

## Architecture Reality

### What We Have

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Next.js (App Router)              │
│                                     │
│  ┌───────────────────────────────┐ │

│  │   - Server-side rendering     │ │
│  └───────────────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### What We Need

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Cloudflare Workers                │
│   (Edge Runtime)                    │
│                                     │
│   - No Node.js APIs                 │
│   - No filesystem                   │
│   - No heavy dependencies          │
│   - V8 Isolates                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**These are fundamentally incompatible architectures.**

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Fix Next.js Font Loader (Recommended)

**Time Estimate:** 30-60 minutes
**Success Probability:** High (90%)

The Next.js font loader bug is likely a configuration issue, not a fundamental blocker.

**Action Plan:**
1. Remove font imports from `layout.tsx`
2. Use system fonts or CDN fonts instead
3. Test build
4. Deploy with @opennextjs/cloudflare (already configured)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Fastest path to working deployment
- ✅ Uses Payload as designed (with Next.js)
- ✅ Full Payload CMS features work
- ✅ Database already seeded (30,186 records)
- ✅ @opennextjs/cloudflare already configured

**Cons:**
- Still using Next.js (heavier bundle)

---

### Option 2: Payload CMS v2 (Standalone Mode)

**Time Estimate:** 4-6 hours
**Success Probability:** Medium (60%)

Payload CMS v2 had better standalone support.

**Action Plan:**
1. Downgrade to Payload v2
2. Use standalone Express server mode
3. Deploy Express as Worker (via @micr)
4. Rewrite all collections for v2 API

**Pros:**
- ✅ No Next.js dependency
- ✅ Designed for standalone servers

**Cons:**
- ❌ Major version downgrade
- ❌ Lose v3 features
- ❌ Need to rewrite collections
- ❌ Database migrations needed
- ❌ May still have Node.js compatibility issues

---

### Option 3: Cloudflare Pages + Workers

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours
**Success Probability:** High (85%)

Deploy Next.js to Cloudflare Pages (not Workers).

**Action Plan:**
1. Keep current Next.js + Payload setup
2. Fix font loader issue
3. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (supports Next.js)
4. Use @cloudflare/next-on-pages adapter

**Pros:**
- ✅ Cloudflare Pages supports Next.js natively
- ✅ No architectural changes needed
- ✅ Full Payload CMS features
- ✅ Better Next.js compatibility than Workers

**Cons:**
- Not pure Workers (uses Pages Functions)
- Larger bundle size

---

### Option 4: Custom Headless API (Clean Sheet)

**Time Estimate:** 8-12 hours
**Success Probability:** High (95%)

Build custom REST API on Workers + Hono, separate admin UI.

**Action Plan:**
1. Create Hono API server on Workers
2. Use D1 directly with Drizzle ORM
3. Build simple admin UI separately
4. Implement HATEOAS manually

**Pros:**
- ✅ Pure Workers deployment
- ✅ Maximum performance
- ✅ Full control
- ✅ No CMS overhead
- ✅ Can still use Payload data model ideas

**Cons:**
- ❌ Need to rebuild admin UI
- ❌ Lose Payload's rich admin features
- ❌ More development time
- ❌ Need to implement auth, media, etc.

---

## Recommendation

**Go with Option 1: Fix Next.js Font Loader**

### Why?

1. **Fastest Time to Production**
   - 30-60 minutes vs 4-12 hours for other options
   - Database already seeded
   - All features already implemented

2. **Lowest Risk**
   - Font loader is configuration, not architecture
   - Known working stack (Next.js + Payload)
   - @opennextjs/cloudflare already configured

3. **Best User Experience**
   - Full Payload CMS admin UI
   - All features work as designed
   - HATEOAS already implemented

### Implementation Steps

```bash
# 1. Remove problematic font imports
# Edit app/layout.tsx - comment out or remove Google Fonts import

# 2. Use system fonts temporarily
# Update CSS to use system font stack

# 3. Test build
pnpm build

# 4. Deploy
wrangler pages deploy
```

### If Font Loader Fix Fails

**Fallback to Option 3: Cloudflare Pages**

Pages has better Next.js support than Workers. Use `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` adapter.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. CMS Platform Lock-In

Payload CMS v3 is tightly coupled to Next.js. Moving to standalone requires:
- Major refactoring
- Potential feature loss
- Compatibility challenges

**Takeaway:** Choose CMS based on deployment target upfront.

### 2. Workers Runtime Limitations

Cloudflare Workers is **not Node.js**. It's a V8 Isolate runtime with limited APIs.

**What Works:**
- Pure JavaScript/TypeScript
- Web APIs (fetch, Response, etc.)
- Minimal dependencies
- Workers-specific APIs (D1, R2, KV, etc.)

**What Doesn't Work:**
- Node.js built-ins (fs, path, crypto, etc.)
- Heavy npm packages
- Server frameworks expecting Node.js

**Takeaway:** Workers is best for lightweight APIs, not full CMSes.

### 3. nodejs_compat Is Not Magic

The `nodejs_compat` flag:
- ✅ Polyfills some Node.js globals
- ✅ Helps with simple dependencies
- ❌ Doesn't provide `fs`, `readline`, advanced crypto
- ❌ Adds significant overhead
- ❌ Not recommended for production

**Takeaway:** Don't rely on nodejs_compat for complex apps.
