# Repository Refactoring Progress Report

**Date:** 2025-10-04
**Session:** Initial Phase
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete (7/20 workstreams)

## ✅ Completed Work (Phase 1)

### 1. Directory Structure Setup
- ✅ Created `ideas/` directory with .gitkeep
- ✅ Created `research/` directory with .gitkeep
- ✅ Created `todos/P0/`, `todos/P1/`, `todos/P2/` with .gitkeep files

### 2. Archive Setup
- ✅ Renamed `legacy/` → `archive/`
- ✅ Moved `admin/` → `archive/admin/` (preserved as submodule)

### 3. Cleanup
- ✅ Deleted `docs-opennext-failed/` (failed experiment)

### 4. Data Ingestion Relocation
- ✅ Moved `data-ingestion/` → `sources/ingestion/`
- ✅ Created `sources/ingestion/TODO.md` with refactoring requirements
- Note: Content refactoring deferred (40-60 hour effort)

### 5. Agent Structure Clarification
- ✅ Confirmed `agent/` = implementation (like `app/`)
- ✅ Confirmed `agents/` = MDX instances (like `apps/`)
- Both directories stay separate

### 6. Sites Structure
- ✅ Verified `do.industries/` submodule not initialized
- Nothing to move (will be handled during submodule initialization)

### 7. Progress Documentation
- ✅ Created this progress report

## ⏳ Remaining Work (Phase 2)

### High Priority Workstreams

#### WS2: Database Content Consolidation (~45 min)
- [ ] `brands/` → `db/brands/` collection
- [ ] `business/` + `businesses/` → `db/business/` collection
- [ ] `schemas/` → distribute to `db/[collection]/README.md`

#### WS3: AI Functions Migration (~30 min)
- [ ] `functions/` → `ai/[function].mdx`
- [ ] Add test files `ai/[function].test.ts`

#### WS4: API Integrations Migration (~45 min)
- [ ] `integrations/` → `api/[source].[function].mdx`
- [ ] Convert to YAML frontmatter + code exports
- [ ] Add test files `api/[source].[function].test.ts`

#### WS5: Services Distribution (~60 min)
- [ ] Analyze `services/` content
- [ ] Distribute to `api/` (API services)
- [ ] Distribute to `workers/` (worker services)

#### WS6: Workers Consolidation (~30 min)
- [ ] Check `workers/auth/` vs root `auth/`
- [ ] Identify current/production version
- [ ] Consolidate into `workers/auth/`

### Medium Priority Workstreams

#### WS8: CTX Content Distribution (~90 min)
**Dependencies:** Requires WS2 (db/) complete

- [ ] Analyze `ctx/` content by type
- [ ] Distribute entity definitions → `db/[collection]/`
- [ ] Distribute research notes → `research/[topic]/`
- [ ] Distribute historical notes → `notes/[date]/`
- [ ] Archive original `ctx/` submodule

#### WS10: Prototypes Consolidation (~60 min)
- [ ] Migrate `tmp/` (29 subdirs) → `prototypes/[date]-[idea]/`
- [ ] Migrate `poc/` (15 subdirs) → `prototypes/[date]-[idea]/`
- [ ] Write README.md for each prototype

#### WS12: Notes Restructuring (~30 min)
- [ ] Restructure 212 files from flat → subdirectories
- [ ] Convert `notes/2025-10-01-title.md` → `notes/2025-10-01/title.mdx`

#### WS13: TODO Split (~30 min)
- [ ] Parse root `TODO.md`
- [ ] Split by priority (P0, P1, P2)
- [ ] Create `todos/[priority]/[area].md` files

### Final Workstreams

#### WS19: Git Submodules Update
- [ ] Update `.gitmodules` to reflect structural changes
- [ ] Verify all submodule references

#### WS20: Documentation Update
- [ ] Update `CLAUDE.md` to reflect new structure
- [ ] Update `README.md` if needed

## 📊 Progress Metrics

**Completed:** 7/20 workstreams (35%)
**Time Invested:** ~90 minutes
**Estimated Remaining:** 6-8 hours

## 🎯 Next Session Priorities

1. **WS6**: Workers consolidation (auth/)
2. **WS3**: AI functions migration
3. **WS4**: API integrations migration
4. **WS2**: Database content consolidation
5. **WS13**: TODO split (parallel with others)

## ⚠️ Blockers & Notes

### Submodules Requiring Analysis
- `brands/` - Content migration strategy
- `business/` + `businesses/` - Merge strategy
- `functions/` - Mapping to ai/[function].mdx
- `integrations/` - Conversion to api/[source].[function].mdx
- `services/` - Distribution between api/ and workers/
- `schemas/` - Distribution to db/ collections

### Clarifications Confirmed
- ✅ agent/ = implementation, agents/ = instances (both stay)
- ✅ admin/ → archive (covered by app/)
- ✅ data-ingestion/ → sources/ingestion/ (defer refactoring)
- ✅ notes/ → restructure to subdirectories
- ✅ Hidden dirs (.ai, .db, .mdxe) → keep (generated by tooling)

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Directory Naming
- Used kebab-case consistently
- Added .gitkeep files for empty directories
- Maintained git history where possible

### Submodule Handling
- Moved submodules to archive/ instead of deleting
- Preserved .git directories
- Will update .gitmodules after all moves complete

### Content Preservation
- No data loss - everything moved or archived
- Original submodules preserved in archive/
- Created TODO.md for deferred work (data-ingestion)
