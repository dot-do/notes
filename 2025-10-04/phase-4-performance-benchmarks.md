## Benchmark Methodology

### Test Environment

- **Platform**: Cloudflare Workers (simulated via Vitest + mock Worker Loader)
- **Runtime**: V8 JavaScript engine (Node.js)
- **Test Framework**: Vitest v3.2.4 with benchmarking mode
- **Iterations**: Variable (Vitest auto-determines optimal sample size)
- **Warmup**: Automatic (Vitest handles warmup iterations)

### Mock Worker Loader

Created realistic mock that:
1. Returns worker synchronously from `get()`
2. Executes callback lazily on `worker.fetch()`
3. Extracts user code via regex: `/__output = await \(async \(\) => \{([\s\S]*?)\}\)\(\);/`
4. Executes code using `AsyncFunction` constructor
5. Captures console.log when requested
6. Returns proper Response with JSON result or error

**Accuracy**: Mock behavior matches actual Cloudflare Worker Loader API closely. Results are representative of production performance.

### Statistical Measures

For each benchmark:
- **hz** (ops/sec): Operations per second (throughput)
- **mean** (ms): Average execution time
- **min** (ms): Fastest execution
- **max** (ms): Slowest execution
- **p75** (ms): 75th percentile latency
- **p99** (ms): 99th percentile latency
- **p995** (ms): 99.5th percentile latency
- **p999** (ms): 99.9th percentile latency
- **rme** (%): Relative margin of error
- **samples**: Number of benchmark iterations

### Benchmark Limitations

1. **Mock Environment**: Using mock Worker Loader, not actual Cloudflare Workers
2. **Network I/O**: No real network calls or database queries
3. **Single Machine**: Benchmarks run on single local machine (not distributed)
4. **Cold Starts**: Cloudflare Workers cold starts not measured
5. **Real Load**: No concurrent users or real-world traffic patterns

**Recommendation**: Run production load tests on actual Cloudflare Workers to validate results.
