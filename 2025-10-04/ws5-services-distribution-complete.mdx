# WS5: Services Distribution - Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-04
**Workstream:** WS5 - Services Distribution (~60 min actual)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Executive Summary

Successfully analyzed and distributed service-related content across the dot-do repository structure. Moved 4 service MDX definitions from ctx/ to services/ repository, and determined that agent/worker/services/ should remain in the agent repository as they are implementation-specific utilities.

## Analysis Performed

### 1. Service Content Types Identified

**Three distinct "services" concepts found:**

1. **Service MDX Definitions** (Business Service Offerings)
   - Location: `ctx/services-as-software/services/`
   - Count: 4 MDX files
   - Type: Content/documentation
   - Purpose: Define services the platform offers to customers
   - Examples: Tax preparation, customer support, content writing, data entry

2. **Agent Worker Services** (Internal Utilities)
   - Location: `agent/worker/services/`
   - Count: 9 service groups, ~12K LOC
   - Type: TypeScript implementation code
   - Purpose: Internal utilities for agent worker (oauth, cache, csrf, rate-limit, deployer, github, analytics, code-fixer, sandbox)
   - Status: STAYS in agent/ repo (tightly coupled to agent implementation)

3. **Platform Worker Services** (Microservices)
   - Location: `workers/[service-name]/`
   - Count: 30+ microservices
   - Type: Cloudflare Workers
   - Purpose: Platform microservices architecture
   - Status: Already properly organized

### 2. services/ MDX Repository

**Current State:**
- Empty repository with configuration only
- Velite + Zod validation setup
- Pattern: `services/**/*.mdx`

**Purpose:**
- Stores service offering definitions
- Syncs to database via repo.do GitHub App
- Part of MDX content layer (like apps/, brands/, workflows/)

## Distribution Decisions

### ✅ Service MDX Definitions → services/ Repository

**Action Taken:**
- Moved 4 MDX files from `ctx/services-as-software/services/` to `services/services/`
- Files moved:
  1. `tax-return-preparation.mdx` (8.5KB, 85% automation, $49-299 pricing)
  2. `customer-support.mdx` (1.2KB, 75% automation, $499-999/mo)
  3. `content-writing.mdx` (1.4KB, 90% automation, $99/post)
  4. `data-entry.mdx` (1.1KB, 95% automation, $0.10/field)

**Categorization Logic:**
- These are business service offerings (not technical services)
- Belong in MDX content repository
- Will sync to database for service catalog
- Map to ONET occupations and GDPval tasks

### ❌ Agent Services → NOT Distributed

**Decision:**
- Agent services stay in `agent/worker/services/`
- These are internal utilities specific to agent implementation
- Tightly coupled to agent architecture
- Used for OAuth, caching, CSRF protection, rate limiting, deployment, GitHub integration, etc.

**Services keeping in agent/:**
1. **analytics** - AI Gateway analytics tracking
2. **cache** - KV-based caching layer
3. **code-fixer** - TypeScript error auto-fixing (largest, ~4K LOC)
4. **csrf** - CSRF token management
5. **deployer** - Cloudflare Workers deployment
6. **github** - GitHub repository operations
7. **oauth** - OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
8. **rate-limit** - Rate limiting with KV and DO storage
9. **sandbox** - Sandbox SDK client (~2.3K LOC)

**Total:** ~12K LOC stays in agent/ (not distributed)

### ✅ Platform Services → Already Properly Organized

**Workers repository has 30+ microservices:**
- Core: gateway, db, auth, schedule, webhooks, email, mcp, queue
- Domain: agents, workflows, business, things
- Integration: stripe, github, anthropic, resend
- AI: embeddings, generation, eval
- Infrastructure: deploy, dispatcher, api

**Status:** No changes needed, already following microservices architecture

## Files Changed

### services/ Repository

**Added:**
```
services/
└── services/
    ├── content-writing.mdx (1.4KB)
    ├── customer-support.mdx (1.2KB)
    ├── data-entry.mdx (1.1KB)
    └── tax-return-preparation.mdx (8.5KB)
```

**Modified:**
```
services/
├── package.json (fixed empty file, added dependencies)
└── CLAUDE.md (modified timestamp)
```

### ctx/ Repository

**To Remove Later** (in WS8: CTX Content Distribution):
```
ctx/services-as-software/services/
├── content-writing.mdx → MOVED to services/
├── customer-support.mdx → MOVED to services/
├── data-entry.mdx → MOVED to services/
└── tax-return-preparation.mdx → MOVED to services/
```

## Validation

### Service MDX Structure

All 4 service files follow consistent schema:

```yaml
---
title: Service Name
tagline: Brief tagline
description: Detailed description
category: Service category
specialty: Specialty area
onetCode: "XX-XXXX.XX"
onetTitle: ONET occupation title
gdpvalTaskId: GDPVAL-XXX-001
estimatedValue: USD amount
automationLevel: 0.XX (percentage)
deliveryType: automated|agent-driven
turnaroundTime: duration
pricing:
  model: subscription|per-unit|tiered
  basePrice: USD amount
  currency: USD
metadata:
  ns: service
  visibility: public
  status: active
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
---
```

### Categorization Verification

**API Services:** None found (API services are in workers/ as microservices)

**Worker Services:**
- Platform workers: 30+ in workers/ ✅
- Agent workers: 9 in agent/worker/services/ ✅ (staying)

**Service Definitions:** 4 MDX files ✅ (moved to services/)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
- [x] Document distribution decisions
- [ ] Commit services/ changes
- [ ] Commit ctx/ removals (or mark for WS8)
- [ ] Update root progress doc

### Future (WS8: CTX Content Distribution)
- [ ] Remove original files from ctx/services-as-software/services/
- [ ] Archive ctx/services-as-software/ subdirectory
- [ ] Update ctx/ CLAUDE.md to reflect service migration

### Velite Build (Post-Workspace Configuration)
- [ ] Configure pnpm workspace to include services/
- [ ] Run `pnpm build` in services/ to validate
- [ ] Test database sync via repo.do webhook

## Ambiguous Cases

**None identified.** All categorization was straightforward:

1. **Business service offerings** → services/ MDX repo ✅
2. **Agent internal utilities** → Stay in agent/ ✅
3. **Platform microservices** → Already in workers/ ✅

## Lessons Learned

### Multiple "Services" Meanings

The term "services" has three distinct meanings in the codebase:

1. **Business Services** - Customer-facing service offerings (services/ MDX repo)
2. **Technical Services** - Platform microservices (workers/ repo)
3. **Utility Services** - Helper classes and utilities (e.g., agent/worker/services/)

**Recommendation:** Consider renaming agent/worker/services/ to agent/worker/utilities/ for clarity

### MDX Content Repositories

Services follows the same pattern as other MDX repos:
- apps/ - Application definitions
- brands/ - Brand identity
- functions/ - Function definitions
- integrations/ - Integration configs
- schemas/ - Schema definitions
- **services/** - Service offerings ← NEW
- sources/ - Data sources
- workflows/ - Workflow patterns
- agents/ - Agent definitions
- business/ - Business entities

All sync bidirectionally with database via repo.do GitHub App.

### Agent Architecture Independence

Agent services are highly specific to agent implementation:
- Use agent's logger (../../logger)
- Integrate with agent's middleware
- Access agent's database services
- Tight coupling is intentional and correct

## Statistics
