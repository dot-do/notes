# VAPI Voice AI → GitHub → Claude Code Integration

**Priority:** P1 - High Priority (Voice-driven project management)
**Status:** Planning
**Target:** Week 2-3 of Q4 2025

---

## Overview

Enable voice-driven project management by connecting VAPI voice AI agent to Claude Code via GitHub issues. This allows conversational brainstorming and task assignment through natural voice interactions.

## Architecture Flow

```
User Voice Command
    ↓
VAPI Voice AI Agent (conversation + understanding)
    ↓
VAPI Custom Function (create GitHub issue)
    ↓
GitHub Issues API (authenticated)
    ↓
GitHub Webhook (issue created/labeled)
    ↓
Claude Code GitHub Actions (triggered)
    ↓
Claude Code Execution (autonomous work)
    ↓
Pull Request Created (with changes)
    ↓
Notification to User (GitHub/Email/Voice)
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Voice Task Assignment
**User:** "Hey VAPI, have Claude create a new function for calculating MRR and add it to the metrics API"

**VAPI Actions:**
- Understands: Need new function for MRR calculation
- Creates GitHub issue with label `claude-code`
- Includes context: metrics API, MRR calculation, Numerics format
- Assigns to Claude Code

**Claude Code Actions:**
- Reads issue from GitHub webhook
- Creates function in `api/src/routes/metrics/mrr.ts`
- Updates `db/src/queries/revenue.ts` with MRR query
- Adds tests
- Creates PR with changes

### 2. Voice Brainstorming
**User:** "I'm thinking we should add tiered pricing to the marketplace. What do you think?"

**VAPI Actions:**
- Engages in conversation about pricing tiers
- Discusses pros/cons, implementation complexity
- User confirms: "Let's do it"
- Creates GitHub issue: "Design and implement tiered marketplace pricing"
- Adds conversation context to issue body

**Claude Code Actions:**
- Reviews issue and context
- Creates design document
- Proposes database schema changes
- Creates implementation plan
- Adds to TODO.md
- Comments on issue with plan for user approval

### 3. Voice Progress Check
**User:** "What's the status on the ctx repository setup?"

**VAPI Actions:**
- Queries GitHub API for related issues/PRs
- Checks TODO.md status
- Synthesizes voice response:
  - "The ctx repository is currently pending. It's Phase 1 of the migration plan."
  - "Would you like me to have Claude start working on it?"

### 4. Voice Debugging
**User:** "The Numerics dashboard is showing wrong GMV numbers. Can you investigate?"

**VAPI Actions:**
- Creates urgent GitHub issue with `bug` and `claude-code` labels
- Includes: Numerics dashboard, GMV metric, data accuracy
- Sets priority high

**Claude Code Actions:**
- Reviews GMV calculation in `api/src/routes/metrics/gmv.ts`
- Checks database queries
- Identifies issue (wrong date range)
- Fixes bug
- Adds test case
- Creates PR with fix

      })
    }

    if (toolCall.function.name === 'check_project_status') {

    }
  }
})

function verifyVapiSignature(signature: string, payload: any): boolean {
  // Implement VAPI signature verification
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', process.env.VAPI_SECRET!)
  const hash = hmac.update(JSON.stringify(payload)).digest('hex')
  return hash === signature
}

## Conversation Patterns

### Natural Language → GitHub Issue Translation

**Voice Input:** "Can you add support for recurring subscriptions to the marketplace?"

**VAPI Understanding:**
- Feature request: recurring subscriptions
- Scope: marketplace functionality
- Priority: Not urgent (P2)

**GitHub Issue Created:**
```markdown
Title: [P2] Add recurring subscription support to marketplace

Body:
Implement recurring subscription functionality for marketplace services.

Requirements (from conversation):
- Monthly and annual billing cycles
- Automatic renewal
- Prorated refunds
- Integration with Stripe

Related to:
- Services.Delivery marketplace (KR2.2)
- Revenue tracking (MRR/ARR metrics)

Context:
User requested this feature during voice brainstorming session.
This will help achieve $1M ARR target by enabling subscription revenue.

```

### Status Query → Voice Response

**Voice Input:** "What's our progress toward the $1M ARR goal?"

**VAPI Process:**
1. Calls `check_project_status` function with query "ARR progress"
2. Backend queries Numerics API `/api/metrics/arr`
3. Returns current ARR and progress percentage

**Voice Response:**
"We're currently at $626,000 in annual recurring revenue, which is 62.6% of the $1M target. We need to grow by $374,000 to hit the goal. Based on current 60% month-over-month growth, we're on track to reach $1M by December."

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: VAPI Setup (Week 2)
- [ ] Create VAPI account and assistant
- [ ] Configure voice, model, and personality
- [ ] Define custom functions (create_github_issue, check_status, list_tasks)
- [ ] Set up serverUrl webhook endpoint

### Phase 2: Webhook Handler (Week 2)
- [ ] Create `/api/vapi/webhook` endpoint in api repo
- [ ] Implement signature verification
- [ ] Add GitHub Octokit integration
- [ ] Test issue creation flow

### Phase 3: GitHub Actions (Week 3)
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/claude-code-vapi.yml`
- [ ] Configure issue triggers with `claude-code` label
- [ ] Add priority parsing from issue title
- [ ] Test Claude Code execution

### Phase 4: Status Queries (Week 3)
- [ ] Implement `check_project_status` function
- [ ] Parse TODO.md for task status
- [ ] Query GitHub API for issues/PRs
- [ ] Integrate with Numerics API for metrics

### Phase 5: Voice Responses (Week 4)
- [ ] Configure VAPI to speak responses
- [ ] Add natural language metric summaries
- [ ] Implement progress calculations
- [ ] Test end-to-end voice conversation

---

## Success Metrics

- [ ] VAPI can create GitHub issues with 100% accuracy
- [ ] Claude Code executes tasks from VAPI within 5 minutes
- [ ] Voice status queries return accurate data
- [ ] <2 second voice response time
- [ ] Zero failed GitHub API calls
- [ ] User satisfaction with voice interaction

---

## Example Voice Conversations

### Brainstorming Session
```
User: Hey VAPI, I want to brainstorm about improving creator onboarding.

VAPI: Great! What aspects of creator onboarding are you thinking about?

User: Well, the Studio interface is complex. New creators get overwhelmed.

VAPI: I see. Are you thinking about a guided tutorial, simplified UI, or maybe a wizard-style flow?

User: A wizard would be perfect. Step by step through defining their service.

VAPI: Excellent idea. This would help with KR3.1 - shipping the Studio interface. Should I have Claude create a design document for this?

User: Yes, make it priority 1.

VAPI: Creating GitHub issue now... Done! Issue #42 created and assigned to Claude. He'll start working on the wizard design document shortly.
```

### Quick Task Assignment
```
User: Have Claude add a gauge chart widget to the Numerics API for dispute rate.

VAPI: Got it. Creating issue for gauge chart widget, dispute rate metric, Numerics format. This is for the metrics API, correct?

User: Yes.

VAPI: Perfect. Issue #43 created. Claude will implement the gauge chart endpoint.
```

### Progress Check
```
User: How many functions do we have catalogued?

VAPI: Let me check... We currently have 887 functions catalogued, which is 88.7% of the 1,000 target for KR1.5. We've added 142 functions in the past month.

User: Nice. What about services in the marketplace?

VAPI: We have 187 services listed, with 92 actively processing transactions. We're 93.5% to the 200 listed target and 92% to the 100 active target.
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. VAPI Signature Verification
- Always verify webhook signatures from VAPI
- Use HMAC-SHA256 with secret key
- Reject invalid signatures immediately

### 2. GitHub Token Scope
- Use fine-grained PAT with minimal scope
- Only `issues:write` permission needed
- Rotate tokens quarterly

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Limit VAPI webhook to 60 requests/minute
- Prevent issue creation spam
- Add cooldown between voice commands

### 4. Content Validation
- Sanitize issue titles and bodies
- Prevent injection attacks
- Validate label names against whitelist
