# Business-as-Code & Services-as-Software Implementation

**Date:** October 2, 2025
**Session:** Claude Code Implementation
**Repository:** ctx.do
**Commit:** a45302a

## Overview

Successfully implemented two revolutionary frameworks for the .do platform:

1. **Business-as-Code** - Express entire businesses as executable specifications
2. **Services-as-Software** - Transform human services into AI-deliverable software

## Research Foundation

### GDPval Framework (OpenAI)

**Discovery:** OpenAI's framework for measuring AI performance on economically valuable real-world tasks.

**Key Details:**
- 1,320 specialized tasks across 44 occupations
- Tasks drawn from top 9 industries contributing to U.S. GDP
- Each task vetted by professionals with 14+ years experience
- Provides measurable economic value assessment
- Tracks automation potential and productivity gains

**Integration:** Map services to GDPval tasks to quantify economic value delivered.

**Example:** Tax preparation service (GDPVAL-TAX-001)
- Traditional CPA: 2 hours at $150/hour = $300
- AI-driven: $17 cost to deliver
- 17.6x productivity gain
- 95.75% cost reduction

### ONET Database (U.S. Department of Labor)

**Discovery:** Comprehensive occupational information database with structured taxonomy.

**Key Details:**
- 1,016 occupational titles (ONET-SOC codes)
- 19,000+ task statements
- Hierarchical organization: 2,000 detailed → 325 intermediate → 41 generalized activities
- Knowledge, Skills, Abilities (KSA) taxonomy
- Standardized level scales (1-7)

**Integration:** Map services to ONET occupations to define skill requirements and automation potential.

**Example:** Tax Preparers (13-2082.00)
- Knowledge: Tax Law (Level 7), Accounting (Level 6)
- Skills: Mathematics (Level 6), Active Listening (Level 5)
- Abilities: Mathematical Reasoning (Level 6)

### AI Agents in Business Operations

**Research Findings:**
- 75% of executives expect AI agents to execute transactional processes autonomously by 2027
- 86% say process automation will be more effective with AI agents
- Agents learn, adapt, and optimize in real-time
- Capacity scales automatically based on workload

**Key Capabilities:**
- Autonomous decision-making using language models
- Real-time adaptation to disruptions
- Learning from past interactions and outcomes
- Digital scalability (expand/contract on demand)

### Infrastructure as Code Patterns

**Extended Concept:** If infrastructure can be code, so can businesses.

**Parallels:**
- Infrastructure as Code → Business as Code
- Policy as Code → Governance as Code
- Ops as Code → Operations as Code

**Conway's Law:** Organizations produce designs that mirror their communication structure.
- Implication: If business is code, structure becomes programmable
- AI agents can reorganize based on optimal patterns

### TypeScript Interface Design

#### Business-as-Code Types

**Company Interface:**
```typescript
interface Company {
  type: 'holding' | 'operating' | 'subsidiary' | 'division'
  parent?: string
  objectives: Objective[]
  roles: Role[]
  offerings: Offering[]
  operations: Operation[]
  metrics: Metric[]
  resources: Resource[]
  governance: Governance
}
```

**Key Innovation:** Cascading OKRs
```typescript
interface Objective {
  level: 'holding' | 'company' | 'department' | 'team' | 'ic'
  parent?: string  // cascade from
  children?: string[]  // cascade to
  // Auto-sync from data sources
  keyResults: KeyResult[]
}
```

**ONET Integration:**
```typescript
interface Role {
  onetCode: string  // e.g., "13-2082.00"
  assignedTo: 'human' | 'agent' | 'hybrid'
  agent?: string  // agent ID if applicable
  ksa: {
    knowledge: Array<{ domain: string; level: number }>
    skills: Array<{ skill: string; level: number }>
    abilities: Array<{ ability: string; level: number }>
  }
}
```

#### Services-as-Software Types

**Service Interface:**
```typescript
interface Service {
  onet?: {
    code: string  // ONET-SOC code
    title: string
  }
  gdpval?: {
    taskId: string
    economicValue: number
  }
  automationLevel: number  // 0-1
  deliveryType: 'automated' | 'agent-driven' | 'human-assisted' | 'fully-managed'
  tasks: Task[]
  quality: QualityStandard[]
}
```

**Task Decomposition:**
```typescript
interface Task {
  type: 'code' | 'generative' | 'human' | 'agentic' | 'hybrid'
  onetTaskId?: string  // Map to ONET task
  automationReadiness: number  // 0-1
  ksa: TaskKSA
  executor?: {
    type: 'code' | 'generative' | 'human' | 'agentic'
    id: string
    fallback?: string
  }
}
```

### Velite Schema Configuration

**Added Collections:**

1. **companies** collection
   ```typescript
   const companies = defineCollection({
     name: 'Company',
     pattern: 'business-as-code/companies/**/*.mdx',
     schema: s.object({
       type: s.enum(['holding', 'operating', 'subsidiary', 'division']),
       industry: s.string(),
       mission: s.string().optional(),
       vision: s.string().optional(),
       values: s.array(s.string()).default([]),
       // ... other fields
     })
   })
   ```

2. **services** collection
   ```typescript
   const services = defineCollection({
     name: 'Service',
     pattern: 'services-as-software/services/**/*.mdx',
     schema: s.object({
       onetCode: s.string().optional(),
       gdpvalTaskId: s.string().optional(),
       estimatedValue: s.number().optional(),
       automationLevel: s.number().optional(),
       deliveryType: s.enum([...]),
       // ... other fields
     })
   })
   ```

## Key Innovations

### 1. Programmatic OKR Tracking

**Concept:** OKRs auto-update from API data sources.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const revenue = await stripe.getARR()
await updateKeyResult('kr-1-1', revenue)
```

**Benefits:**
- Real-time progress tracking
- Automatic alerts on at-risk objectives
- Dashboards aggregate across levels
- No manual status updates

### 2. Human-AI Role Assignment

**Three Models:**

**Fully AI:**
- Well-defined processes
- Measurable outputs
- Low judgment required
- Examples: Data entry, calculations

**Hybrid (AI + Human):**
- AI handles routine work
- Human reviews complex cases
- Defined escalation rules
- Examples: Tax prep (85% AI), customer support (75% AI)

**Fully Human:**
- Strategic planning
- Creative work
- Relationship building
- Examples: Executive roles, sales

### 3. Economic Value Measurement

**GDPval Integration:**

Every service quantifies:
- Traditional delivery cost
- AI-driven delivery cost
- Productivity gain
- Economic value created

**Example:**
```mdx
## Integration with GDPval

Value Metrics:
- Service value: $350
- Traditional cost: $300
- AI cost: $17
- Net benefit: $333
- Productivity gain: 17.6x
```

### 4. ONET Skill Mapping

**Structured Taxonomy:**

Every service maps to:
- ONET occupation code
- Required knowledge domains
- Required skills
- Required abilities
- Automation potential per task

**Example:**
```typescript
ksa: {
  knowledge: [
    { domain: "Tax Law", level: "expert", automated: true },
    { domain: "Accounting", level: "advanced", automated: true }
  ]
}
```

### 5. Automated Governance

**Policy as Code:**

```mdx
## Spending Authorization Policy

Rules:
- < $1,000: Auto-approved (any team member)
- $1,000 - $10,000: Manager approval (Slack workflow)
- $10,000 - $100,000: Director + CFO notification
- > $100,000: Board approval

Automation: Slack integration routes to appropriate approver
```
