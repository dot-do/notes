# WS-003 Dependency Check Report

**Date:** 2025-10-02
**Agent:** Backend Engineer C
**Task:** WS-003 @api/ Gateway Implementation
**Status:** BLOCKED - Dependencies not ready

---

## Executive Summary

**WS-003 cannot proceed** because both required dependencies (WS-001 and WS-002) are incomplete:

- **WS-001 (@db/)**: Partially scaffolded, RPC service NOT implemented
- **WS-002 (@auth/)**: NOT started, no standalone service exists

**Recommendation:** Assign Backend Engineers A and B to complete WS-001 and WS-002 immediately before WS-003 can begin.

---

## Detailed Dependency Analysis

### WS-001: @db/ RPC Service - ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY COMPLETE

**What Exists:**
```
‚úÖ /Users/nathanclevenger/Projects/.do/db/package.json
‚úÖ /Users/nathanclevenger/Projects/.do/db/wrangler.jsonc
‚úÖ Database schema definitions
‚úÖ Migration files
‚úÖ Scripts for data import
```

**What's Missing:**
```
‚ùå /Users/nathanclevenger/Projects/.do/db/src/index.ts (WorkerEntrypoint)
‚ùå RPC service implementation
‚ùå Query modules in src/queries/
‚ùå Transaction helpers
‚ùå Unit tests
‚ùå Deployment to staging
```

**Required Implementation:**
```typescript
// @db/src/index.ts - DOES NOT EXIST
export class DatabaseService extends WorkerEntrypoint<Env> {
  async getThing(ns: string, id: string): Promise<Thing | null>
  async createThing(data: NewThing): Promise<Thing>
  async updateThing(ns: string, id: string, updates: Partial<NewThing>): Promise<Thing>
  async deleteThing(ns: string, id: string): Promise<void>
  async getRelationships(fromNs: string, fromId: string): Promise<Relationship[]>
  async fullTextSearch(query: string, options?: SearchOptions): Promise<Thing[]>
  async vectorSearch(embedding: number[], options?: SearchOptions): Promise<Thing[]>
  async hybridSearch(query: string, embedding: number[], options?: HybridSearchOptions): Promise<Thing[]>
}
```

**Deployment Status:**
```bash
$ wrangler deployments list --name db-service
# Expected: Service deployed with version info
# Actual: Service likely NOT deployed
```

**Service Binding Test:**
```typescript
// Test from another worker
const db = env.DB_SERVICE as DatabaseService
const thing = await db.getThing('onet', 'software-developers')
// Expected: Returns Thing object or null
// Actual: WOULD FAIL - service binding not available
```

---

### WS-002: @auth/ RPC Service - ‚ùå NOT STARTED

**What Exists:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Auth logic exists in /Users/nathanclevenger/Projects/.do/api.services/auth/
‚ö†Ô∏è better-auth implementation in monolith
‚ö†Ô∏è Some auth code in /Users/nathanclevenger/Projects/.do/api/auth/
```

**What's Missing:**
```
‚ùå Standalone @auth/ service repository
‚ùå /Users/nathanclevenger/Projects/.do/auth/ directory (does NOT exist as separate service)
‚ùå WorkerEntrypoint RPC service
‚ùå Service bindings configuration
‚ùå Deployment to staging
```

**Required Implementation:**
```typescript
// @auth/src/index.ts - DOES NOT EXIST
export class AuthService extends WorkerEntrypoint<Env> {
  async validateToken(token: string): Promise<User | null>
  async validateApiKey(key: string): Promise<User | null>
  async getUserById(id: string): Promise<User | null>
  async createSession(userId: string): Promise<Session>
  async getSession(sessionId: string): Promise<Session | null>
  async deleteSession(sessionId: string): Promise<void>
}
```

**Note:** Auth code needs to be extracted from:
- `/Users/nathanclevenger/Projects/.do/api.services/auth/` (monolith)
- `/Users/nathanclevenger/Projects/.do/api/auth/` (partially scaffolded in gateway)

And consolidated into a standalone RPC service.

---

### WS-003: @api/ Gateway - üü° SCAFFOLDED BUT NOT READY

**Current State:**
```
‚úÖ /Users/nathanclevenger/Projects/.do/api/index.ts exists
‚úÖ Hono app with route modules
‚úÖ Middleware (auth, cors, logger)
‚úÖ Package.json with dependencies
```

**Problems:**
```
‚ùå Current implementation is NOT a pure gateway
‚ùå Contains business logic (route handlers)
‚ùå No service bindings configured
‚ùå No domain routing implemented
‚ùå No path routing implemented
‚ùå Cannot route to @db/ (service doesn't exist)
‚ùå Cannot route to @auth/ (service doesn't exist)
```

**Current Implementation (WRONG for Gateway):**
```typescript
// @api/index.ts - Current
import coreRoutes from './routes/core'
import aiRoutes from './routes/ai'
// ... more route imports

app.route('/api/v1/core', coreRoutes)  // ‚ùå Business logic
app.route('/api/v1/ai', aiRoutes)      // ‚ùå Business logic
```

**Required Implementation (PURE GATEWAY):**
```typescript
// @api/src/index.ts - Required
import { DOMAIN_ROUTES } from './routes/domain-routing'
import { PATH_ROUTES } from './routes/path-routing'

app.all('*', async (c) => {
  const url = new URL(c.req.url)

  // Pure routing - NO business logic
  const service = getDomainService(url.hostname) || getPathService(url.pathname)
  return await c.env[service].fetch(c.req.raw)
})
```

---

## Testing Dependencies

### Test Case 1: Can we call @db/ service?
```typescript
// @api/tests/integration.test.ts
const db = env.DB_SERVICE as DatabaseService
const thing = await db.getThing('onet', 'software-developers')
```

**Current Status:** ‚ùå WOULD FAIL
- Service binding not configured
- @db/ service not deployed
- DatabaseService class doesn't exist

---

### Test Case 2: Can we validate tokens via @auth/?
```typescript
// @api/src/middleware/auth.ts
const auth = c.env.AUTH_SERVICE as AuthService
const user = await auth.validateToken(token)
```

**Current Status:** ‚ùå WOULD FAIL
- Service binding not configured
- @auth/ service doesn't exist
- AuthService class doesn't exist

---

### Test Case 3: Can we route requests?
```typescript
// Test: https://agents.do/list
const req = new Request('https://agents.do/list')
const res = await app.fetch(req, env)
```

**Current Status:** ‚ùå WOULD FAIL
- Domain routing not implemented
- Service bindings not configured
- Target services don't exist yet

---

## Impact Analysis

### What CAN'T be done without WS-001 and WS-002:

1. **Gateway Routing:**
   - Cannot route database queries to @db/
   - Cannot validate authentication via @auth/
   - Cannot test service bindings

2. **Microservices Pattern:**
   - Other services (WS-101 to WS-315) also depend on @db/ and @auth/
   - Cannot start any downstream workstreams
   - Entire parallel execution strategy is blocked

3. **Testing:**
   - Cannot write integration tests
   - Cannot verify routing performance
   - Cannot test middleware

4. **Deployment:**
   - Cannot deploy gateway without service dependencies
   - Cannot configure custom domains
   - Cannot test in staging environment

---

## Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (Today):
1. ‚úÖ **Document WS-003 implementation plan** (DONE)
2. ‚úÖ **Report dependency status** (THIS DOCUMENT)
3. ‚è≥ **Assign Backend Engineer A to WS-001 (@db/)**
4. ‚è≥ **Assign Backend Engineer B to WS-002 (@auth/)**

### WS-001 Tasks (Backend Engineer A):
```
Priority: P0 - Critical Path
Duration: 3-5 days
```
1. Create `@db/src/index.ts` with WorkerEntrypoint class
2. Implement RPC methods for all database operations
3. Create query modules in `@db/src/queries/`
4. Write unit tests (80%+ coverage)
5. Deploy to staging as `db-service`
6. Verify RPC calls work from test client
7. Document API in `@db/README.md`

### WS-002 Tasks (Backend Engineer B):
```
Priority: P0 - Critical Path
Duration: 3-5 days
```
1. Create standalone `@auth/` service (extract from monolith)
2. Create `@auth/src/index.ts` with WorkerEntrypoint class
3. Implement RPC methods for authentication
4. Integrate better-auth library
5. Write unit tests (80%+ coverage)
6. Deploy to staging as `auth-service`
7. Verify token validation works from test client
8. Document API in `@auth/README.md`

### WS-003 Tasks (Backend Engineer C - ME):
```
Priority: P0 - Critical Path
Duration: 4-5 days
Blocked Until: WS-001 and WS-002 complete
```
1. ‚è∏Ô∏è **WAIT** for WS-001 deployment
2. ‚è∏Ô∏è **WAIT** for WS-002 deployment
3. Test service bindings from gateway
4. Implement domain routing configuration
5. Implement path routing configuration
6. Create authentication middleware (calls @auth/)
7. Create rate limiting middleware
8. Write integration tests
9. Deploy gateway to staging
10. Performance testing

## Timeline Impact

**Original Plan:**
```
Week 1-2: Foundation Phase (WS-001, WS-002, WS-003 in sequence)
Week 3-4: Core Services (WS-101 to WS-110 in parallel)
```

**Current Status:**
```
Day 1: WS-001 and WS-002 NOT started ‚ùå
Day 2: WS-003 BLOCKED ‚è∏Ô∏è
Day 3-5: WS-001 and WS-002 implementation
Day 6-10: WS-003 implementation
Week 3+: Core Services can start (IF foundation complete)
```

**Risk:** 1-2 week delay if WS-001 and WS-002 are not prioritized immediately.

---

## Service Bindings Configuration (Reference)

Once WS-001 and WS-002 are deployed, the gateway will need these bindings:

```jsonc
// @api/wrangler.jsonc
{
  "services": [
    {
      "binding": "DB_SERVICE",
      "service": "db-service",
      "entrypoint": "DatabaseService"
    },
    {
      "binding": "AUTH_SERVICE",
      "service": "auth-service",
      "entrypoint": "AuthService"
    },
    // ... 30+ more service bindings
  ]
}
```

---

## Verification Checklist

Before WS-003 can proceed, verify:

### WS-001 Verification:
- [ ] `wrangler deployments list --name db-service` shows deployment
- [ ] Service accessible at `https://db-service.ACCOUNT.workers.dev`
- [ ] RPC test: `const thing = await env.DB_SERVICE.getThing('onet', 'test')`
- [ ] All database operations working
- [ ] Performance: <10ms p95 for RPC calls

### WS-002 Verification:
- [ ] `wrangler deployments list --name auth-service` shows deployment
- [ ] Service accessible at `https://auth-service.ACCOUNT.workers.dev`
- [ ] RPC test: `const user = await env.AUTH_SERVICE.validateToken('test')`
- [ ] Token validation working
- [ ] Performance: <5ms p95 for validation

### WS-003 Ready:
- [ ] Both WS-001 and WS-002 verified
- [ ] Service bindings configured in `@api/wrangler.jsonc`
- [ ] Test environment configured
- [ ] Implementation plan reviewed

## Summary

**Current State:** BLOCKED
**Dependencies:** 2 services (WS-001, WS-002)
**Blocker Status:** BOTH incomplete
**Impact:** Cannot start WS-003 implementation
**Recommendation:** Prioritize WS-001 and WS-002 immediately

**Timeline:**
- WS-001 and WS-002: 3-5 days each (can be parallel)
- WS-003: 4-5 days (after dependencies complete)
- Total: ~8-15 days for foundation phase

**Next Action:** Assign engineers to WS-001 and WS-002, wait for completion before starting WS-003.
