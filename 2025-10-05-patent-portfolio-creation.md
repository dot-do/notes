---

## Methodology

### 1. Research Phase (30 minutes)

**Files Analyzed:**
- `/Users/nathanclevenger/Projects/.do/SEMANTICS.md` - Semantic triple network architecture
- `/Users/nathanclevenger/Projects/.do/ABSTRACTIONS.md` (2,963 lines) - Business-as-Code system
- `/Users/nathanclevenger/Projects/.do/workers/CLAUDE.md` - Protocol-agnostic microservices
- `/Users/nathanclevenger/Projects/.do/sdk/CLAUDE.md` - 5-layer SDK architecture (121 packages)
- `/Users/nathanclevenger/Projects/.do/admin/README.md` - Scalable admin platform
- `/Users/nathanclevenger/Projects/.do/sdk/packages/402.do/README.md` - Micropayment protocol
- `/Users/nathanclevenger/Projects/.do/sdk/packages/graphdl/README.md` - Type system

**Key Findings:**
- 600x code amplification (142 lines → 90,000 lines)
- 70-80% code reduction through protocol-agnostic architecture
- 95%+ cache hit rates in JIT compilation
- 105:1 download multiplier in package ecosystem
- Production-validated innovations across 12,087 LOC

### 2. SCAMPER Analysis

**Substitute:** Multiple protocol implementations → Single MDXLD source

**Adapt:** Schema.org for business operations (Business-as-Code)
**Modify:** MDX from documentation format to executable specification
**Put to Other Uses:** Humans as async functions in code execution
**Eliminate:** Duplicate implementations across 9+ protocols
**Reverse:** Documentation-first development (docs generate code, not vice versa)

### 3. Patent Selection (10 identified)

**Criteria:**
- **Novelty:** Low prior art risk
- **Non-obviousness:** Significant technical innovation
- **Utility:** Proven in production
- **Commercial Value:** Large addressable markets
- **Strategic Importance:** Defensive and licensing potential

```
Task: Draft USPTO patent application for [Innovation]
Inputs:
  - Specific source files for innovation
  - USPTO format requirements
  - Prior art considerations
Output:
  - Complete patent application (50-90KB)
