## 1. Directory Prioritization & Value Scores

### Value Score Methodology

**Formula:**
```
Value Score = Domain Authority × (Traffic in millions)

Where:
- Domain Authority = Ahrefs DR (0-100)
- Traffic = Estimated monthly visits (SimilarWeb data)
```

**Interpretation:**
- **500K+:** Must-have, highest priority
- **100K-500K:** High-value, second priority
- **20K-100K:** Good-value, third priority
- **<20K:** Niche-value, fourth priority

### Tier 1: Must-Have Directories (DA 70+ OR 10M+ traffic)

**Our Solution:** api.do provides a pure gateway pattern. One entry point routes requests to 30+ specialized workers via Workers RPC with sub-10ms latency. Zero cold starts, global edge deployment, 100% type safety.

**Key Features:**
- 🚀 Deploy 30 microservices in 30 seconds
- ⚡ Sub-10ms RPC latency (no HTTP overhead)
- 🌍 Global edge deployment to 300+ cities
- 🔒 Built-in auth, rate limiting, monitoring
- 💰 Free tier: 100K requests/day

Built it after getting frustrated with Lambda cold starts and Kubernetes complexity. Would love your feedback!

**Special PH Offer:** First 100 signups get 3 months of Pro free.

**Directory:** Capterra, GetApp, Software Advice
**Priority:** P0 - CRITICAL
**Value Score:** 1,287,000 combined (736K + 231K + 320K)
**Category:** SaaS Directory
**Approval Time:** 3-7 days

**Submission Details:**

**Product Name:** api.do API Gateway
**Category:** API Management Software
**Subcategory:** API Gateway, Microservices Platform

**Short Description (100 chars):**
Production-ready API gateway for Cloudflare Workers. 30+ microservices, sub-10ms latency, 100K requests/day free.

**Long Description (500 words):**
api.do is a production-ready API gateway and microservices platform built on Cloudflare's global edge network. Designed for developers and DevOps teams who want the power of microservices architecture without the complexity of Kubernetes, service meshes, or traditional infrastructure management.

**The Problem:** Traditional microservices require complex orchestration, service discovery, load balancing, and infrastructure maintenance. Serverless platforms like AWS Lambda have 3-10 second cold starts. Most teams want to focus on building features, not managing infrastructure.

**The Solution:** api.do provides a pure gateway pattern where a single entry point routes incoming HTTP requests to 30+ specialized microservice workers based on domain, path, and method. Using Cloudflare Workers RPC (Service Bindings), the gateway makes sub-10ms RPC calls to the appropriate service with zero cold starts and global edge deployment.

**Key Features:**
- **Pure Gateway Architecture:** Routing only, no business logic in gateway
- **Workers RPC:** Sub-10ms service communication with type-safe interfaces
- **30+ Pre-Built Services:** Database, Auth, AI, Email, Webhooks, Scheduling, Queue, and more
- **Zero Cold Starts:** V8 isolates start in <1ms, unlike Lambda (3-10s)
- **Global Edge:** Deploy once, run in 300+ cities worldwide
- **Built-in Authentication:** WorkOS SSO, SAML, API keys, sessions, RBAC
- **Rate Limiting:** By IP, user, endpoint
- **Comprehensive Monitoring:** Real-time dashboards, logs, metrics
- **TypeScript-First:** 100% type safety across all services
- **Open Source:** MIT licensed, full source on GitHub

**Use Cases:**
- SaaS backends requiring authentication, database, and AI integration
- API platforms needing high performance and global distribution
- Startups wanting to deploy quickly without infrastructure complexity
- Enterprise teams migrating from AWS Lambda or traditional servers

**Deployment:** Deploy to production with one command (`wrangler deploy`). No containers, no Kubernetes, no DevOps team required.

**Pricing:**
- **Free Tier:** 100K requests/day (3M/month), all 30+ microservices, global edge deployment, 99.9% uptime SLA, email support
- **Pro Plan:** $20/month for 10M requests, priority support, custom domains
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing, dedicated infrastructure, SLAs, on-premise options

**Support:** Email support (free tier), priority support (paid tiers), comprehensive documentation, active Discord community, GitHub discussions.

## 8. Submission Tips & Best Practices

### Writing Compelling Descriptions

**Formula:**
1. **Hook (1 sentence):** Value prop + differentiator
2. **Problem (1-2 sentences):** What pain does it solve?
3. **Solution (2-3 sentences):** How does it work?
4. **Benefits (3-5 bullets):** Key features with outcomes
5. **Social Proof (1 sentence):** Users, metrics, traction
6. **CTA (1 sentence):** Clear next step

**Example (api.do, 150 words):**
```
api.do is a production-ready API gateway for Cloudflare Workers microservices.

Traditional microservices require Kubernetes, service meshes, and extensive infrastructure management. Most developers want to build features, not manage clusters.

api.do provides a pure gateway pattern where a single entry point routes requests to 30+ specialized workers with sub-10ms RPC latency. Zero cold starts, global edge deployment, built-in authentication, and monitoring.

Key benefits:
- Deploy 30 microservices in 30 seconds
- Sub-10ms latency (vs Lambda's 3-10s cold starts)
- Free tier: 100K requests/day
- Type-safe TypeScript SDK
- Open source (MIT license)

Currently processing 100K+ requests/day for production applications.

Start free at api.do - no credit card required.
```

**Why this works:**
- Opens with clear value prop
- Identifies relatable problem
- Explains solution simply
- Bullet list easy to scan
- Includes social proof
- Actionable CTA

---

### Increasing Acceptance Rates

**Do's:**
✅ **Follow guidelines exactly** - Read submission rules carefully
✅ **Use high-quality assets** - Professional logo, clear screenshots
✅ **Write unique descriptions** - Don't copy-paste generic text
✅ **Include social proof** - Users, metrics, GitHub stars
✅ **Respond quickly** - Answer admin questions within 24 hours
✅ **Be honest** - Don't exaggerate claims or fake metrics
✅ **Proofread** - Zero typos, perfect grammar

**Don'ts:**
❌ **Submit spam** - Only submit to relevant directories
❌ **Keyword stuff** - Natural language, not SEO spam
❌ **Use all caps** - Professional tone
❌ **Ignore rejection feedback** - Learn and improve
❌ **Submit broken links** - Test all URLs first
❌ **Forget UTM tracking** - Always include for attribution

---

### Handling Rejections

**Common Rejection Reasons:**

1. **"Doesn't fit our category"**
   - **Fix:** Choose more appropriate category or directory
   - **Resubmit:** Usually no, find better match

2. **"Not enough traction/users"**
   - **Fix:** Wait until 1,000+ users or significant metrics
   - **Resubmit:** Yes, after 3-6 months

3. **"Description too short/generic"**
   - **Fix:** Expand description, add specific details
   - **Resubmit:** Yes, immediately with improvements

4. **"Website not mobile-friendly"**
   - **Fix:** Improve mobile responsiveness
   - **Resubmit:** Yes, after fixing

5. **"Broken links"**
   - **Fix:** Verify all URLs work
   - **Resubmit:** Yes, immediately

6. **"Duplicate submission"**
   - **Fix:** Check if already listed, contact admin
   - **Resubmit:** No, resolve duplicate first

**Resubmission Strategy:**
- Wait 2-4 weeks before resubmitting
- Address specific feedback
- Write new description (don't reuse rejected version)
- Improve assets if possible
- Add new traction/metrics

**Acceptance Rate After Resubmission:** 40-60% (if feedback addressed properly)

---

### Tracking & Attribution

**UTM Parameters (Critical):**

**Format:**
```
https://api.do?utm_source=[directory-name]&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=free-directories-2025
```

**Examples:**
```
Product Hunt: ?utm_source=producthunt&utm_medium=launch&utm_campaign=free-directories-2025
Capterra: ?utm_source=capterra&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=free-directories-2025
GitHub: ?utm_source=github&utm_medium=awesome-list&utm_campaign=awesome-cloudflare-workers
```

**Google Analytics Setup:**
- Enable UTM tracking in GA4
- Create custom report: Acquisition → Traffic acquisition → Filter by utm_campaign=free-directories-2025
- Track conversions: Signups, trial starts, purchases

**Weekly Monitoring:**
- Check UTM traffic every Monday
- Identify top-performing directories
- Compare traffic vs DA (value validation)
- Adjust strategy based on data

**Attribution Window:** 30 days (first-touch attribution)

## 9. Automation Opportunities

### Partially Automatable Tasks

**1. Submission Form Pre-Fill (Browser Extensions)**
- Use LastPass, 1Password, or custom browser extension
- Store common fields (company name, description, URLs, tags)
- Auto-fill forms with one click
- **Time Saved:** 40-50% per submission

**2. Screenshot Automation (Playwright/Puppeteer)**
```typescript
// scripts/generate-screenshots.ts
import { chromium } from 'playwright'

async function captureScreenshot(url: string, outputPath: string) {
  const browser = await chromium.launch()
  const page = await browser.newPage({ viewport: { width: 1920, height: 1080 } })
  await page.goto(url)
  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')
  await page.screenshot({ path: outputPath, fullPage: false })
  await browser.close()
}

// Capture dashboard
await captureScreenshot('https://api.do/dashboard', './screenshots/api-do-dashboard.png')
```
**Time Saved:** 5-10 hours

**3. UTM Link Generation (Script)**
```typescript
// scripts/generate-utm-links.ts
const directories = ['producthunt', 'capterra', 'g2', 'stackshare']
const baseUrl = 'https://api.do'

directories.forEach(dir => {
  const url = `${baseUrl}?utm_source=${dir}&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=free-directories-2025`
  console.log(`${dir}: ${url}`)
})
```
**Time Saved:** 1-2 hours

**4. Spreadsheet Updates (Google Sheets API)**
```typescript
// scripts/update-submission-status.ts
import { GoogleSpreadsheet } from 'google-spreadsheet'

async function updateStatus(directoryName: string, status: string) {
  const doc = new GoogleSpreadsheet(SHEET_ID)
  await doc.useServiceAccountAuth(credentials)
  await doc.loadInfo()
  const sheet = doc.sheetsByIndex[0]
  const rows = await sheet.getRows()
  const row = rows.find(r => r.DirectoryName === directoryName)
  if (row) {
    row.Status = status
    row.ApprovalDate = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]
    await row.save()
  }
}
```
**Time Saved:** 2-3 hours

---

### Fully Manual Tasks (Cannot Automate)

**1. Writing Unique Descriptions**
- While we have templates, each directory may need tweaks
- Some require unique text (plagiarism detection)
- **Time:** 5-10 min per directory

**2. Selecting Categories**
- Each directory has different category structure
- Requires human judgment
- **Time:** 2-5 min per directory

**3. Responding to Admin Questions**
- Questions are unique and require context
- Cannot automate human interaction
- **Time:** Variable (5-30 min when needed)

**4. Quality Control**
- Reviewing submissions before clicking "Submit"
- Verifying links work
- Proofreading
- **Time:** 5-10 min per directory

**Total Automation Potential:** 30-40% time savings (70-85 hours → 45-55 hours with automation)
