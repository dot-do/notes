💡 TypeScript Tip: Type-safe environment variables

Instead of:
❌ process.env.API_KEY

Do this:
✅
type Env = {
  API_KEY: string
}

export default {
  async fetch(req: Request, env: Env) {
    // env.API_KEY is typed!
  }
}

---

## 5. Hacker News Strategy

### 5.1 Submission Strategy

**Best Practices:**
- **Best days:** Tuesday-Thursday
- **Best times:** 8-10am EST
- **Frequency:** 1-2 submissions/month max (avoid spam)

**Content to Submit:**
- Major releases (e.g., "Show HN: .do - Open source microservices platform")
- Architecture deep-dives (e.g., "Why we chose Workers RPC over REST")
- Performance benchmarks (e.g., "Cloudflare Workers vs Lambda: 10x faster")
- Technical post-mortems (e.g., "How we scaled to 1M requests")
- "Ask HN" discussions (e.g., "Ask HN: How do you structure microservices?")

**Title Guidelines:**
- Use original title or modify slightly
- No clickbait
- No ALL CAPS
- No emoji
- Be specific and intriguing

**Good Titles:**
```
Show HN: .do – Open source microservices platform on Cloudflare Workers
Why we chose Workers RPC over REST for microservices (and you should too)
Cloudflare Workers vs AWS Lambda: Performance comparison
```

**Bad Titles:**
```
Check out our AMAZING new platform! 🚀
You won't believe how fast Cloudflare Workers are
The best microservices platform ever built
```

### 5.2 Submission Process

**1. Create Submission:**
- Use "Submit" link on HN
- Choose appropriate type (Story, Ask HN, Show HN)
- Include URL if linking to article

**2. Monitor First 2 Hours:**
- Check every 30 minutes
- Reply to comments quickly
- Provide additional context

**3. Participate in Discussion:**
- Reply to ALL questions
- Be humble and informative
- Acknowledge limitations
- Thank people for feedback
- Don't argue aggressively

**4. Follow Up:**
- Monitor for 24 hours
- Reply to late comments
- Note feedback for future improvements

### 5.3 Response Strategy

**Example Responses:**

**Question:**
```
How does this compare to Vercel?
```

**Response:**
```
Great question! Here's how we're different:

.do focuses on backend microservices (API, database, auth), while Vercel focuses on frontend deployment.

Key differences:
- We use Workers (V8 isolates), Vercel uses Lambda (containers)
- We provide 8 microservices out-of-the-box
- We're 100% open source, Vercel is proprietary

That said, you can use both together! Deploy frontend on Vercel, backend on .do.
```

**Criticism:**
```
This seems unnecessarily complex.
```

**Response:**
```
Fair criticism! Here's our thinking:

For simple projects, you're right - monoliths are simpler. We built this for teams that:
- Need independent scaling
- Want fault isolation
- Have multiple developers working in parallel

That said, we provide a single-command deploy for all services, so the complexity is mostly under the hood.

What use case are you solving for? Happy to discuss if this fits your needs.
```

**Comparison:**
```
How is this different from X?
```

**Response:**
```
Good question! Here's how we compare:

**Similarities:**
- Both use [technology]
- Both support [feature]

**Differences:**
- We use Workers (edge), X uses Lambda (regional)
- We're open source, X is proprietary
- We provide [unique feature]

Honestly, both are good choices depending on your needs. We're optimized for [use case].
```

### 5.4 What NOT to Do

❌ **Manipulate votes** (vote rings, asking for upvotes)
❌ **Spam submissions** (more than 2/month)
❌ **Ignore comments** (must participate)
❌ **Be defensive** (acknowledge criticism graciously)
❌ **Self-promote excessively** (focus on value)

---

## 6. Stack Overflow Strategy

### 6.1 Target Tags

**Primary Tags (Answer Questions):**
- [cloudflare-workers] (1,500+ questions)
- [typescript] (200,000+ questions)
- [microservices] (15,000+ questions)
- [edge-computing] (500+ questions)
- [drizzle] (Drizzle ORM, 300+ questions)
- [hono] (Hono framework, 200+ questions)

**Secondary Tags:**
- [postgresql] (when relevant)
- [api] (when relevant)
- [authentication] (when relevant)

### 6.2 Answer Strategy

**Find Questions:**
1. Search for unanswered questions in target tags
2. Sort by "Newest" or "Active"
3. Look for questions you can answer well

**Answer Structure:**

```markdown
**Short Answer:**
[One-sentence solution]

**Detailed Explanation:**
[Why this works, when to use it]

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// Working code example
```

**Alternative Approaches:**
- [Alternative 1]
- [Alternative 2]

**Additional Resources:**
- [Official docs link]
- [Tutorial link (only if genuinely helpful)]

Let me know if you have questions!
```

**Example Answer:**

**Question:** "How do I use environment variables in Cloudflare Workers?"

**Answer:**
```markdown
**Short Answer:**
Environment variables are passed as the second parameter to your `fetch` handler.

**Code:**
```typescript
export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
    const apiKey = env.API_KEY
    return new Response(`API Key: ${apiKey}`)
  }
}
```

**Type Safety:**
For type-safe environment variables, define an `Env` type:

```typescript
type Env = {
  API_KEY: string
  DATABASE_URL: string
}
```

**Setting Variables:**
- Locally: `.dev.vars` file
- Production: `wrangler secret put API_KEY`

**More Info:**
- [Cloudflare Docs: Environment Variables](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables/)

Let me know if you have questions!
```

### 6.3 Linking to .do

**When It's Appropriate:**
✅ Question is directly about microservices architecture
✅ Question asks for examples or tutorials
✅ .do docs genuinely solve their problem
✅ You've already provided a complete answer

**When It's NOT Appropriate:**
❌ Question is unrelated to .do
❌ You haven't answered the question fully
❌ It feels spammy or self-promotional

**How to Link:**
```markdown
**Note:** If you're building microservices on Workers, we've documented this pattern extensively in our [microservices guide](https://docs.do/microservices). It might help!
```

### 6.4 Building Reputation

**Goal: Earn Badges and Rep**
- Answer 5-10 questions per week
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Edit questions for clarity (helps SEO)
- Upvote good questions and answers

**Benefits of High Rep:**
