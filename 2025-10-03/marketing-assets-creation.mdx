**500-word version:**
api.do is a production-ready API gateway and intelligent request router built on Cloudflare's global edge network. Designed for developers who want the power of microservices architecture without the complexity of Kubernetes, service meshes, or infrastructure management.

**The Problem:** Traditional microservices require complex orchestration, service discovery, load balancing, and infrastructure maintenance. Most developers want to focus on building features, not managing infrastructure. Serverless platforms like AWS Lambda have cold starts and complex configurations. Monolithic APIs become unmaintainable as they grow.

**The Solution:** api.do provides a pure gateway pattern where a single entry point routes requests to 30+ specialized microservice workers. Each service is small (200-500 lines), focused, and independently deployable. The gateway handles routing, authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring - you handle business logic.

**Architecture Deep Dive:** Every request hits the api.do gateway, which examines the domain, path, and HTTP method to determine which microservice should handle it. Using Cloudflare Workers RPC (Service Bindings), the gateway makes sub-10ms RPC calls to the appropriate service. No network hops, no cold starts, no container orchestration. Services communicate via typed RPC interfaces, ensuring compile-time safety across your entire system.

**Authentication & Security:** Built-in authentication with WorkOS (SSO, SAML, Google/GitHub OAuth), API key management with automatic rotation, session handling with encrypted cookies, role-based access control (RBAC) with flexible permissions, rate limiting by IP address, user ID, or endpoint, request validation with Zod schemas, comprehensive audit logging, automatic security headers, DDoS protection via Cloudflare's network.

auth.do is a comprehensive authentication and authorization service built specifically for B2B SaaS applications. Provides enterprise-grade SSO, SAML, OAuth, API key management, session handling, role-based access control (RBAC), user provisioning, and audit logging - all via WorkOS integration without the complexity of building and maintaining auth infrastructure.

**The Problem:** Authentication for B2B SaaS is complex. Enterprise customers demand SSO (Google, Microsoft, Okta), SAML support, directory sync (SCIM), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and audit logging. Building auth from scratch takes months. Maintaining security, handling edge cases, and staying compliant with SOC 2/GDPR/HIPAA is ongoing work. Most startups underestimate auth complexity and build insecure systems.

**The Solution:** auth.do wraps WorkOS (the industry-leading auth platform) and provides a simple RPC interface for all auth operations. Support Google/GitHub OAuth in minutes. Add SAML for enterprise customers with zero configuration. API keys, sessions, RBAC included. Comprehensive audit logging. SOC 2 compliant out of the box.

**Enterprise SSO with WorkOS:** Support for Google OAuth, GitHub OAuth, Microsoft OAuth, SAML 2.0 (Okta, OneLogin, Azure AD, and 50+ providers), magic links (passwordless), multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforcement, device trust. Customers use their existing identity provider - no password management, no password resets, no security breaches from weak passwords.

**Directory Sync (SCIM):** Automatic user provisioning when employees join customer's organization. Automatic deprovisioning when employees leave. Group/team sync. Profile updates (name, email, role) propagate automatically. Eliminate manual user management for enterprise customers.

**API Key Management:** Generate API keys for programmatic access to your platform. Automatic rotation on schedule (30/60/90 days). Scoped permissions per key (read-only, write, admin). Rate limiting by key. Revoke keys instantly (if compromised). Audit trail of all key usage. Multiple keys per user (dev/staging/prod). Prefix-based key identification (ak_live_..., ak_test_...). Secure storage with encryption.

**Session Management:** Encrypted session cookies (httpOnly=true, secure=true, sameSite=Strict). JWT tokens with automatic refresh before expiration. Rolling sessions (extend on activity). Session expiration after inactivity (configurable: 15min to 30 days). Device tracking and management (list active sessions, force logout from specific device or all devices). Session storage in @db/ PostgreSQL (persistent) or Durable Objects (low-latency).

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Flexible permission system. Built-in roles: admin (full access), editor (create/update content), viewer (read-only), custom roles (define your own). Permission checks enforced automatically at RPC level - workers call `env.auth.requirePermission('posts.write')` and get error if user lacks permission. Resource-level permissions (user can edit their own posts but not others'). Hierarchical roles (admin inherits editor permissions). Dynamic role assignment based on organization membership or team.

**User Management:** User creation and provisioning (manual or automatic via SCIM). Profile management (name, email, avatar, metadata). Email verification (send magic link). Password reset (if using password auth, not SSO). Account deletion with full data cleanup (GDPR compliant). User search and filtering by name/email/role/organization. Bulk operations (invite 100 users, change roles, export data).

**Security & Compliance:** Encrypted cookies with automatic secrets rotation (every 7 days). CSRF protection (token-based). Rate limiting by IP address and user ID (prevent brute force). Suspicious activity detection (multiple failed logins, IP changes). Automatic security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS). Audit logging for all auth operations (login, logout, permission changes, API key usage). SOC 2 Type II compliant. GDPR compliant (user data deletion, export). HIPAA ready (BAA available for enterprise).

**Audit Logging:** Comprehensive logs of all authentication events: user login (IP, device, location), logout, failed login attempts, password reset, email verification, API key created/rotated/revoked, permission granted/revoked, role changed, session expired, SSO configured, SAML connection added. Store in ClickHouse for long-term retention and analysis. Export logs for compliance audits. Real-time alerts on suspicious activity.

**Developer Experience:** TypeScript SDK with 100% type safety. Workers RPC interface (env.auth.verifySession, env.auth.requirePermission). Middleware for automatic auth checking (protect routes without manual checks). Testing utilities with mock users and sessions. Local development mode (bypass auth for testing). OpenAPI docs auto-generated. Integration tests covering all auth flows.

**Multi-Tenancy Support:** Isolated organizations/workspaces. User can belong to multiple organizations. Switch organizations without re-login. Organization-level settings (SSO config, RBAC roles, branding). Invite users to organization. Transfer ownership.

**Pricing:** Free tier includes 1,000 monthly active users (MAU), unlimited API keys, RBAC, session management, SSO with Google/GitHub/Microsoft, audit logging, email support. SAML SSO: $1/user/month (enterprise customers). Enterprise plans: custom pricing, priority support, SLAs, dedicated infrastructure, on-premise deployment, custom auth flows, white-label.

**300-word version:**
workers.do is a complete microservices platform built on Cloudflare Workers. Get a production-ready backend with 30+ specialized services in minutes. Each service is small, focused, and independently deployable. Zero infrastructure management, zero cold starts, global edge deployment.

**Microservices Architecture:** 30+ pre-built services including database RPC, authentication, AI integration, email sending, webhook processing, cron scheduling, queue management, MCP server, storage, search, analytics, CDN, and more. Each service is 200-500 lines of focused code. Add your own services using the same patterns.

**Workers RPC (Service Bindings):** Services communicate via typed RPC calls with sub-10ms latency. No network hops, no HTTP overhead, no serialization costs. Example: `const user = await env.db.users.findById(123)`. Type-safe interfaces ensure compile-time correctness across your entire system.

**Zero Cold Starts:** Cloudflare Workers use V8 isolates, not containers. First request takes <1ms. Subsequent requests are instant. No more waiting 3-10 seconds for Lambda cold starts. Perfect for user-facing APIs and real-time applications.

**Global Edge Deployment:** Deploy once, run in 300+ cities worldwide. Requests routed to nearest data center automatically. Sub-100ms latency for users anywhere. No multi-region configuration needed.

**Independent Scaling:** Each service scales independently based on traffic. Hot paths (authentication) can handle millions of requests while cold paths (admin APIs) use minimal resources. Only pay for what you use.

**Developer Experience:** TypeScript-first with 100% type safety. Hot reload in development. Deploy to production with one command. Comprehensive error handling. Real-time monitoring and logging. OpenAPI/Swagger docs auto-generated.

**500-word version:**
workers.do is a production-ready microservices platform built on Cloudflare's global edge network. Provides 30+ pre-built specialized microservices that handle common backend tasks - authentication, database access, AI integration, email, webhooks, scheduling, queues, and more. Deploy a complete backend in minutes without managing infrastructure, containers, or Kubernetes.

**The Problem:** Building microservices is hard. Traditional approaches require Kubernetes, service meshes, load balancers, API gateways, service discovery, distributed tracing, log aggregation, and 10+ tools just to run "hello world". Serverless platforms like AWS Lambda have 3-10 second cold starts. Running 30+ microservices traditionally costs $5,000+/month in infrastructure before any traffic.

**The Solution:** workers.do provides 30+ pre-built microservices running on Cloudflare Workers with zero cold starts, sub-10ms RPC latency, global edge deployment, and a free tier for 100K requests/day. Each service is small (200-500 lines), independently deployable, and communicates via Workers RPC (Service Bindings) for type-safe, fast communication.

**Microservices Architecture:** Pure gateway pattern where the @api/ gateway routes incoming HTTP requests to 30+ specialized workers based on domain, path, and method. Gateway handles routing, authentication, rate limiting, monitoring - services handle business logic. Services include:

**Core Services (8):** Gateway (request routing), Database (PostgreSQL/ClickHouse via Drizzle ORM), Authentication (WorkOS SSO/SAML/API keys/RBAC), Schedule (cron jobs with retry logic), Webhooks (Stripe/GitHub/WorkOS/Resend event processing), Email (Resend transactional emails), MCP (Model Context Protocol server for AI agents), Queue (message processing, async workflows).

**AI Services (5):** AI generation (text), AI embeddings (vectors), AI chat (conversations), Workers AI (edge inference), LLM hub (unified access to 50+ models).

**Data Services (5):** Storage (R2/KV/Durable Objects), Search (full-text, vector similarity), Analytics (ClickHouse time-series), Import (CSV/JSON data ingestion), Export (data export to various formats).

**Integration Services (6):** Stripe (payments), GitHub (repos, issues, PRs), WorkOS (SSO/directory sync), Resend (emails), Cloudflare (DNS/KV/R2/D1/Analytics), OpenAI (GPT models).

**Developer Services (6):** CDN (static assets), SDK (TypeScript client generation), Docs (API documentation), Logs (structured logging), Metrics (performance monitoring), Errors (exception tracking).

**Workers RPC (Service Bindings):** All inter-service communication uses Workers RPC with sub-10ms latency. No HTTP overhead, no network serialization, no service discovery needed. Type-safe interfaces generated from service definitions. Example: `env.db.users.findById(123)` is a direct RPC call to the database worker with compile-time type checking.

**Zero Cold Starts with V8 Isolates:** Unlike AWS Lambda (3-10s cold starts) or Cloud Run (1-5s), Cloudflare Workers use V8 isolates that start in <1ms. First request and millionth request have identical latency. Perfect for user-facing APIs, webhooks, real-time applications, and any workload where latency matters.

**Global Edge Deployment:** Deploy once to Cloudflare's network of 300+ cities worldwide. User requests automatically routed to nearest data center. Sub-100ms latency for users in US, Europe, Asia, Australia, South America, Africa. No multi-region configuration, no DNS routing, no CDN setup - just global by default.

**Independent Scaling:** Each microservice scales independently based on actual traffic. Hot paths (authentication, database) can handle millions of requests per second while cold paths (admin APIs, import jobs) use minimal resources. No wasted capacity. No over-provisioning. Pay only for what you use.

**Developer Experience:** TypeScript-first with 100% type coverage across all services. Define RPC interfaces once, get type-safe clients automatically. Hot reload in development (see changes instantly). Deploy to production with `wrangler deploy`. Rollback to previous version in seconds. Comprehensive error handling with detailed stack traces.
