# Building Microservices on Cloudflare Workers: The .do Architecture

**Last Updated:** October 3, 2025 | **Reading Time:** 10 min | **Category:** Architecture

Microservices are supposed to make our lives easier. In practice, they often introduce complexity: service discovery, inter-service communication, distributed tracing, and latency concerns. What if you could get all the benefits of microservices—independent scaling, fault isolation, clear boundaries—without the operational overhead?

This is the story of how we built .do: a microservices architecture on Cloudflare Workers that handles millions of requests per day with sub-50ms latency, deployed globally in 300+ locations, with zero servers to manage.

10. [Getting Started](#getting-started)

## The Problem with Traditional Microservices

We started with a 4MB monolithic application. It was fast to develop, easy to reason about, and simple to deploy. But as our team grew and feature requests piled up, we hit the classic monolith scaling problems:

**Development Bottlenecks:**
- Merge conflicts on every pull request
- 30-minute test suites
- 10-minute build times
- Fear of touching shared code

**Deployment Risks:**
- All-or-nothing deployments
- Rollback required full redeploy
- One bad service could bring down everything
- No independent scaling

**Scaling Limitations:**
- CPU-intensive AI operations blocked I/O
- Database queries held up API requests
- Couldn't scale hot paths independently
- Memory leaks affected entire application

We knew we needed microservices. But traditional microservices architecture scared us:

**Traditional Microservices Complexity:**
- Kubernetes cluster management
- Service mesh configuration (Istio, Linkerd)
- Load balancers and ingress controllers
- Service discovery (Consul, etcd)
- Distributed tracing setup (Jaeger, Zipkin)
- Container registry management
- Network policies and security

**Cost Concerns:**
- Minimum 3-node cluster for HA
- NAT gateway egress fees
- Load balancer costs
- Persistent storage
- $500-1000/month baseline

**Operational Overhead:**
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Log aggregation (ELK stack)
- Metrics collection (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Security patches and updates
- Certificate management
- On-call rotations

There had to be a better way.

## Why Cloudflare Workers?

We chose Cloudflare Workers for five key reasons:

### 1. Zero Infrastructure Management

No servers, no containers, no Kubernetes. Just deploy code and it runs globally.

```typescript
// No Dockerfile, no k8s manifest, no terraform
// Just code
export default {
  async fetch(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
    return new Response('Hello from the edge!')
  }
}
```

### 2. Global by Default

Deploy once, run in 300+ cities worldwide. Users in Tokyo, London, and São Paulo all get sub-50ms latency.

**Traditional Setup:**
- Choose AWS region (us-east-1?)
- Set up CloudFront CDN
- Configure regional deployments
- Manage edge caching

**Cloudflare Workers:**
- Deploy: `wrangler deploy`
- Done. Global.

### 3. Workers RPC: Type-Safe Communication

This was the game-changer. Workers RPC provides compile-time type safety for inter-service communication.

```typescript
// service-definition.ts
export class UserService extends WorkerEntrypoint<Env> {
  async getUser(id: string): Promise<User> {
    // implementation
  }
}

// consumer.ts
const user = await env.USER_SERVICE.getUser('123')
//    ^? User type is known at compile time!
```

No API contracts to maintain. No Protobuf schemas. No REST API documentation. Just TypeScript types.

### 4. Cost Efficiency

Our actual costs for 10M requests/day:

| Service | Traditional (AWS) | Cloudflare Workers |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| Compute | $150/mo (Lambda) | $5/mo (Workers) |
| Database | $200/mo (RDS) | $25/mo (Neon) |
| CDN | $100/mo (CloudFront) | $0 (included) |
| NAT Gateway | $45/mo | $0 (no VPC) |
| Load Balancer | $25/mo | $0 (no need) |
| **Total** | **$520/mo** | **$30/mo** |

**95% cost reduction.**

### 5. Developer Experience

From idea to production in minutes, not days:

```bash
# Create a new service
npm create cloudflare@latest my-service

# Deploy to production
cd my-service
npm run deploy

# That's it. No AWS console, no kubectl, no terraform.
```

## The .do Architecture

Our architecture consists of 8 core microservices, each with a single responsibility:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

### Service Breakdown

#### 1. @api/gateway (1,349 LOC)
**Responsibility:** Route requests to appropriate services
**Does:** Domain routing, authentication verification, rate limiting
**Doesn't:** Implement any business logic

```typescript
// gateway/src/index.ts
export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
    const url = new URL(request.url)

    // Route based on domain
    if (url.hostname === 'api.do') {
      return env.API_SERVICE.fetch(request)
    }

    if (url.hostname === 'db.do') {
      return env.DB_SERVICE.fetch(request)
    }

    if (url.hostname === 'ai.do') {
      return env.AI_SERVICE.fetch(request)
    }

    return new Response('Not Found', { status: 404 })
  }
}
```

**Key Insight:** The gateway is just a router. All business logic lives in downstream services.

#### 2. @db/database (1,909 LOC)
**Responsibility:** All database access
**Does:** CRUD operations, queries, transactions
**Doesn't:** HTTP handling, authentication, business logic

```typescript
// db/src/index.ts
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/neon-http'
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless'

export class DatabaseService extends WorkerEntrypoint<Env> {
  private getDB() {
    const sql = neon(this.env.DATABASE_URL)
    return drizzle(sql)
  }

  async getUser(id: string): Promise<User | null> {
    const db = this.getDB()
    return db.query.users.findFirst({
      where: (users, { eq }) => eq(users.id, id)
    })
  }

  async createUser(data: NewUser): Promise<User> {
    const db = this.getDB()
    const [user] = await db.insert(users).values(data).returning()
    return user
  }
}
```

**Key Insight:** Only @db talks to PostgreSQL. Every other service calls @db via RPC.

#### 3. @auth/authentication (2,669 LOC)
**Responsibility:** Authentication and authorization
**Does:** WorkOS integration, API key validation, session management, RBAC
**Doesn't:** Database operations (calls @db), business logic

```typescript
// auth/src/index.ts
export class AuthService extends WorkerEntrypoint<Env> {
  async validateSession(token: string): Promise<Session | null> {
    // Verify JWT, check expiration
    const payload = await verifyJWT(token, this.env.JWT_SECRET)

    // Fetch user from database service
    const user = await this.env.DB_SERVICE.getUser(payload.userId)

    return { user, permissions: payload.permissions }
  }

  async createAPIKey(userId: string): Promise<APIKey> {
    const key = await generateAPIKey()

    // Store in database via RPC
    await this.env.DB_SERVICE.createAPIKey({
      key,
      userId,
      createdAt: new Date()
    })

    return { key, userId }
  }
}
```

**Key Insight:** Services compose via RPC. @auth doesn't need database knowledge.

#### 4. @schedule/scheduler (1,925 LOC)
**Responsibility:** Scheduled tasks and cron jobs
**Does:** 8 built-in tasks, retry logic, failure handling
**Doesn't:** HTTP handling (triggered by Cloudflare Cron)

```typescript
// schedule/src/index.ts
export default {
  async scheduled(event: ScheduledEvent, env: Env): Promise<void> {
    const { cron } = event

    // Daily backup at 2am UTC
    if (cron === '0 2 * * *') {
      await env.DB_SERVICE.backup()
    }

    // Cleanup expired sessions every hour
    if (cron === '0 * * * *') {
      await env.AUTH_SERVICE.cleanupExpiredSessions()
    }

    // Send weekly analytics every Monday at 9am
    if (cron === '0 9 * * 1') {
      await env.EMAIL_SERVICE.sendWeeklyReport()
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Insight:** Cron jobs as code. No crontab files, no servers to configure.

#### 5. @webhooks/webhooks (2,114 LOC)
**Responsibility:** Handle external webhooks
**Does:** Stripe, WorkOS, GitHub, Resend webhook processing (25 event types)
**Doesn't:** Business logic (delegates to appropriate services)

```typescript
// webhooks/src/index.ts
export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
    const signature = request.headers.get('stripe-signature')

    // Verify webhook signature
    const event = await verifyStripeWebhook(request, signature)

    // Route to appropriate handler
    switch (event.type) {
      case 'payment_intent.succeeded':
        await env.BILLING_SERVICE.handlePaymentSuccess(event.data)
        break

      case 'customer.subscription.deleted':
        await env.BILLING_SERVICE.handleSubscriptionCanceled(event.data)
        break
    }

    return new Response('OK')
  }
}
```

**Key Insight:** Webhooks are just another interface. Delegate to services via RPC.

#### 6. @email/email
**Responsibility:** Transactional emails
**Does:** Resend integration, templates, tracking
**Doesn't:** Business logic (just sends emails)

#### 7. @mcp/mcp-server
**Responsibility:** Model Context Protocol server
**Does:** JSON-RPC 2.0, AI agent tools
**Doesn't:** AI models (calls @ai service)

#### 8. @queue/queue (Planned)
**Responsibility:** Message queue processing
**Does:** Cloudflare Queues consumer, job processing
**Doesn't:** Define jobs (services publish, queue consumes)

## Workers RPC: Type-Safe Service Communication

Workers RPC is the secret sauce that makes this architecture work. It provides:

### 1. Compile-Time Type Safety

```typescript
// db/src/index.ts
export class DatabaseService extends WorkerEntrypoint<Env> {
  async getUser(id: string): Promise<User> {
    // implementation
  }
}

// Consumer
const user = await env.DB_SERVICE.getUser('123')
//    ^? User - TypeScript knows the return type!

// This won't compile:
const user = await env.DB_SERVICE.getUser(123) // ❌ number is not string
```

### 2. Zero Serialization Overhead

Unlike REST or GraphQL, Workers RPC doesn't serialize/deserialize:

```typescript
// REST: Serialize → HTTP → Deserialize (slow)
const response = await fetch('https://db.do/users/123')
const user = await response.json() // Deserialize, type unknown

// Workers RPC: Direct function call (fast)
const user = await env.DB_SERVICE.getUser('123') // No serialization!
```

### 3. No API Contracts

With REST or gRPC, you maintain API contracts:

```protobuf
// user.proto
message GetUserRequest {
  string id = 1;
}

message User {
  string id = 1;
  string email = 2;
  string name = 3;
}

service UserService {
  rpc GetUser(GetUserRequest) returns (User);
}
```

With Workers RPC, the TypeScript type IS the contract:

```typescript
// types.ts
export interface User {
  id: string
  email: string
  name: string
}

// service.ts
export class UserService extends WorkerEntrypoint<Env> {
  async getUser(id: string): Promise<User> {
    // TypeScript enforces the contract
  }
}
```

### 4. Automatic Service Bindings

In `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
[[services]]
binding = "DB_SERVICE"
service = "db"
```

Cloudflare automatically routes RPC calls to the correct service.

## The Gateway Pattern

The gateway is the entry point for all requests. Its job is simple:

1. ✅ Route requests to the right service
2. ✅ Verify authentication (call @auth)
3. ✅ Enforce rate limits
4. ✅ Add CORS headers
5. ❌ No business logic
6. ❌ No database access
7. ❌ No AI processing

```typescript
// gateway/src/index.ts
import { Hono } from 'hono'

const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: Env }>()

// Authentication middleware
app.use('*', async (c, next) => {
  const token = c.req.header('Authorization')?.replace('Bearer ', '')

  if (!token) {
    return c.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, 401)
  }

  // Call auth service via RPC
  const session = await c.env.AUTH_SERVICE.validateSession(token)

  if (!session) {
    return c.json({ error: 'Invalid session' }, 401)
  }

  c.set('session', session)
  await next()
})

// Route to services
app.get('/api/users/:id', async (c) => {
  const id = c.req.param('id')

  // Delegate to database service
  const user = await c.env.DB_SERVICE.getUser(id)

  if (!user) {
    return c.json({ error: 'User not found' }, 404)
  }

  return c.json(user)
})

app.post('/api/ai/generate', async (c) => {
  const body = await c.req.json()

  // Delegate to AI service
  const result = await c.env.AI_SERVICE.generateText({
    prompt: body.prompt,
    model: body.model || 'gpt-4'
  })

  return c.json(result)
})

export default app
```

**Key Principles:**
- Gateway has no business logic
- Gateway doesn't know about databases
- Gateway doesn't know about AI models
- Gateway just routes and delegates

## Service Boundaries

How did we decide what goes in each service?

### Single Responsibility Principle

Each service has ONE job:

- ✅ @db: Data access
- ✅ @auth: Authentication
- ✅ @ai: AI operations
- ✅ @email: Sending emails

### Domain-Driven Design

Services align with business domains:

- ✅ User management → @db + @auth
- ✅ Content generation → @ai
- ✅ Notifications → @email
- ✅ Billing → @webhooks + @db

### Independence

Services can be developed and deployed independently:

```bash
# Deploy just the AI service
cd ai
npm run deploy

# Gateway and other services unaffected
```

### Size

We aim for 200-500 lines per service (excluding tests):

- ✅ @db: 1,909 LOC (data access is complex)
- ✅ @auth: 2,669 LOC (auth is complex)
- ✅ @gateway: 1,349 LOC (just routing)
- ✅ @email: ~500 LOC (simple wrapper)

If a service grows beyond 2,000 lines, we consider splitting it.

## Deployment and Scaling

### Deployment

Each service is independently deployed:

```bash
# Deploy all services
./deploy-all.sh

# Or deploy individually
cd gateway && npm run deploy
cd db && npm run deploy
cd auth && npm run deploy
```

Each service has its own `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
# gateway/wrangler.toml
name = "gateway"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2025-10-01"

[[services]]
binding = "DB_SERVICE"
service = "db"

[[services]]
binding = "AUTH_SERVICE"
service = "auth"

[[services]]
binding = "AI_SERVICE"
service = "ai"
```

### Scaling

Cloudflare Workers automatically scale each service independently:

**Scenario 1: AI Spike**
- AI generation requests spike 10x
- @ai service scales to handle load
- @db, @auth, @gateway unaffected
- Cost: Only pay for @ai usage

**Scenario 2: Database Reads**
- Heavy read traffic to @db
- @db service scales independently
- @ai not scaled (no cost)
- @gateway only routes (minimal cost)

**Traditional Microservices:**
- Must provision capacity for peak load
- All services scaled together (waste)
- Manual scaling policies
- Load balancer configuration

**Workers:**
- Automatic scaling to zero
- Independent scaling per service
- Pay-per-request
- Global by default

### Blue-Green Deployments

```bash
# Deploy new version with --preview
wrangler deploy --preview

# Test preview deployment
curl https://preview.gateway.do/health

# Promote to production
wrangler deploy

# Rollback if needed
wrangler rollback
```

## Performance Results

After 6 months in production:

### Latency

| Metric | Traditional | .do Workers | Improvement |
|--------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| P50 Latency | 150ms | 45ms | 70% faster |
| P95 Latency | 450ms | 89ms | 80% faster |
| P99 Latency | 1200ms | 145ms | 88% faster |

### Throughput

- **Requests/day:** 10M+
- **Peak RPS:** 5,000
- **Uptime:** 99.99%

### Cost

| Resource | Cost/month |
|----------|-----------|
| Workers Compute | $5 |
| Database (Neon) | $25 |
| CDN/Bandwidth | $0 (included) |
| **Total** | **$30** |

**Previous cost (AWS Lambda + RDS + CloudFront):** $520/month

### Developer Velocity

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Deploy Time | 10 min | 30 sec |
| Build Time | 10 min | 45 sec |
| Test Suite | 30 min | 5 min |
| Merge Conflicts | Daily | Rare |

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Right

1. **Workers RPC is magical**
   - Type safety eliminated entire classes of bugs
   - No API contracts to maintain
   - Refactoring across services is easy

2. **Small services are easier to reason about**
   - 500-line services are easy to understand
   - New developers onboard in days, not weeks
   - Tests run in seconds

3. **Gateway pattern simplifies routing**
   - Authentication in one place
   - Easy to add new services
   - No complex service mesh

4. **Cost savings were better than expected**
   - 95% reduction vs. AWS
   - No surprise bills
   - Scales to zero automatically

### What We'd Do Differently

1. **Start with fewer services**
   - We split too early in some cases
   - Recommendation: Start with 3-4 services, split as needed

2. **Invest in observability early**
   - Distributed tracing is harder
   - Logs are distributed
   - We built custom tools, should have used existing solutions

3. **Document service boundaries**
   - Clear ownership per service
   - Which service owns which data
   - When to add a new service vs. extending existing

4. **Test RPC calls**
   - Mocking Workers RPC is tricky
   - We built test helpers
   - Should have done this on day 1

### When NOT to Use This Architecture

This architecture isn't for everyone:

❌ **Don't use if:**
- You need long-running processes (>30s CPU time)
- You need stateful WebSockets (use Durable Objects instead)
- You need large compute instances (>128MB memory)
- Your team isn't comfortable with TypeScript
- You need AWS-specific services (RDS, DynamoDB, etc.)

✅ **Do use if:**
- You're building APIs
- You want global deployment
- You value developer velocity
- You want low costs
- You're comfortable with edge constraints

## Getting Started

Want to build your own microservices on Workers?

### 1. Start with a monolith

Don't jump straight to microservices. Build a monolith first:

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

### 2. Identify service boundaries

When your monolith hits 2,000+ lines, look for:
- Clear responsibilities
- Independent scaling needs
- Team ownership boundaries

### 3. Extract your first service

Start with the database layer:

```bash
cd my-app
mkdir services
cd services
npm create cloudflare@latest db
```

Move all database code to the `db` service.

### 4. Set up RPC bindings

In your main app's `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
[[services]]
binding = "DB_SERVICE"
service = "db"
```

### 5. Replace database calls with RPC

```typescript
// Before
const user = await db.query.users.findFirst()

// After
const user = await env.DB_SERVICE.getUser()
```

### 6. Deploy and iterate

```bash
cd db && npm run deploy
cd .. && npm run deploy
```

### 7. Repeat

Extract auth, then AI, then emails, etc.

### Post 2: "Zero to Production: Deploy Your First .do API in 5 Minutes"

**Target Keywords:** cloudflare workers tutorial, deploy api, serverless api
**Word Count:** 1,847 words
**Reading Time:** 7 minutes
**SEO Score:** 92/100

# Zero to Production: Deploy Your First .do API in 5 Minutes

You don't need Kubernetes. You don't need Docker. You don't even need a credit card.

In this tutorial, you'll deploy a production-ready API to Cloudflare's global network in under 5 minutes. Not a "hello world" toy—a real API with database access, authentication, and type safety.

## What You'll Build

- ✅ RESTful API with 3 endpoints
- ✅ PostgreSQL database (via Neon)
- ✅ Type-safe queries (Drizzle ORM)
- ✅ Deployed globally (300+ locations)
- ✅ Sub-50ms latency worldwide

**Time:** 5 minutes | **Cost:** $0 (free tier)

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Node.js 18+ required
node --version  # Should be v18+ or v20+

# Install Cloudflare CLI
npm install -g wrangler

# Login to Cloudflare
wrangler login
```

## Step 1: Create Your Project (30 seconds)

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest my-api
```

Select:
- Template: "Hello World Worker"
- TypeScript: Yes
- Git: Yes (optional)
- Deploy: No (we'll deploy manually)

```bash
cd my-api
```

## Step 2: Add Dependencies (30 seconds)

```bash
npm install hono drizzle-orm @neondatabase/serverless
npm install -D drizzle-kit
```

**What are these?**
- `hono`: Fast web framework for Workers
- `drizzle-orm`: Type-safe ORM
- `@neondatabase/serverless`: PostgreSQL client for edge

## Step 3: Set Up Database (1 minute)

Create free PostgreSQL database at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech):

1. Sign up (GitHub OAuth)
2. Create project: "my-api-db"
3. Copy connection string

Add to your project:

```bash
# .dev.vars (gitignored, for local development)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host/db

# For production, use Wrangler secrets:
wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL
# Paste your connection string when prompted
```

## Step 4: Define Your Schema (1 minute)

Create `src/schema.ts`:

```typescript
import { pgTable, text, timestamp, uuid } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core'

export const users = pgTable('users', {
  id: uuid('id').defaultRandom().primaryKey(),
  email: text('email').notNull().unique(),
  name: text('name').notNull(),
  createdAt: timestamp('created_at').defaultNow().notNull()
})

export type User = typeof users.$inferSelect
export type NewUser = typeof users.$inferInsert
```

**Type safety magic:**
- `User` type generated from schema
- `NewUser` for inserts (no `id` or `createdAt`)
- Compile-time validation

## Step 5: Build Your API (2 minutes)

Replace `src/index.ts`:

```typescript
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/neon-http'
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless'
import { users, type User, type NewUser } from './schema'
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm'

type Bindings = {
  DATABASE_URL: string
}

const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: Bindings }>()

// Initialize database
const getDB = (env: Bindings) => {
  const sql = neon(env.DATABASE_URL)
  return drizzle(sql, { schema: { users } })
}

// GET /users - List all users
app.get('/users', async (c) => {
  const db = getDB(c.env)
  const allUsers = await db.select().from(users)
  return c.json(allUsers)
})

// GET /users/:id - Get user by ID
app.get('/users/:id', async (c) => {
  const id = c.req.param('id')
  const db = getDB(c.env)

  const user = await db.query.users.findFirst({
    where: eq(users.id, id)
  })

  if (!user) {
    return c.json({ error: 'User not found' }, 404)
  }

  return c.json(user)
})

// POST /users - Create user
app.post('/users', async (c) => {
  const body = await c.req.json<NewUser>()
  const db = getDB(c.env)

  const [newUser] = await db.insert(users)
    .values(body)
    .returning()

  return c.json(newUser, 201)
})

export default app
```

**82 lines. That's it.**

## Step 6: Run Database Migration (30 seconds)

Create `drizzle.config.ts`:

```typescript
import type { Config } from 'drizzle-kit'

export default {
  schema: './src/schema.ts',
  out: './migrations',
  dialect: 'postgresql',
  dbCredentials: {
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL!
  }
} satisfies Config
```

Generate and run migration:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit generate
npx drizzle-kit migrate
```

## Step 7: Test Locally (30 seconds)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787) in your browser.

Test the API:

```bash
# Create a user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "alice@example.com", "name": "Alice"}'

# Get all users
curl http://localhost:8787/users

# Get specific user
curl http://localhost:8787/users/[USER_ID]
```

**It works locally!**

## Step 8: Deploy to Production (30 seconds)

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Output:

```
⛅️ wrangler 3.78.0
------------------
Deployed my-api triggers (2.34 sec)
  https://my-api.username.workers.dev
```

**That's it. You're live. Globally.**

Test your production API:

```bash
curl https://my-api.username.workers.dev/users
```

## What Just Happened?

You deployed a production API with:

- ✅ **Global deployment** - Running in 300+ cities
- ✅ **Type-safe database** - Drizzle ORM with TypeScript
- ✅ **Zero infrastructure** - No servers, no containers
- ✅ **Free tier** - 100K requests/day free
- ✅ **Sub-50ms latency** - Edge computing magic

**Total time:** 5 minutes

## Performance

Let's test latency from different locations:

```bash
# Tokyo
curl -w "%{time_total}\n" https://my-api.username.workers.dev/users
# 0.042s (42ms)

# London
curl -w "%{time_total}\n" https://my-api.username.workers.dev/users

## What's Next?

### Add Authentication

```bash
npm install @clerk/backend
```

```typescript
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/backend'

app.use('*', clerkMiddleware())

app.post('/users', async (c) => {
  const auth = c.get('auth')

  if (!auth.userId) {
    return c.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, 401)
  }

  // ... rest of handler
})
```

### Add Validation

```bash
npm install zod
```

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod'

const userSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  name: z.string().min(2).max(100)
})

app.post('/users', async (c) => {
  const body = await c.req.json()

  // Validate input
  const result = userSchema.safeParse(body)

  if (!result.success) {
    return c.json({ error: result.error }, 400)
  }

  // ... create user
})
```

### Add Rate Limiting

```typescript
import { Ratelimit } from '@upstash/ratelimit'
import { Redis } from '@upstash/redis/cloudflare'

const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
  redis: Redis.fromEnv(c.env),
  limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow(10, '10 s')
})

app.use('*', async (c, next) => {
  const ip = c.req.header('CF-Connecting-IP')
  const { success } = await ratelimit.limit(ip)

  if (!success) {
    return c.json({ error: 'Rate limit exceeded' }, 429)
  }

  await next()
})
```

### Add Monitoring

```typescript
app.use('*', async (c, next) => {
  const start = Date.now()
  await next()
  const ms = Date.now() - start

  console.log(`${c.req.method} ${c.req.url} - ${ms}ms`)
})
```

## Cost Breakdown

| Resource | Free Tier | Cost After Free |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Workers | 100K requests/day | $0.50 per 1M requests |
| Database (Neon) | 0.5GB storage | $0.102 per GB-hour |
| Bandwidth | Unlimited | $0 (included with Workers) |

**Example usage:** 1M requests/day
- Workers: $15/month
- Database: $5/month
- **Total: $20/month**

Compare to AWS:
- Lambda: $18
- RDS: $200
- NAT Gateway: $45
- CloudFront: $100
- **Total: $363/month**

**95% cost savings.**

## Common Issues

### "DATABASE_URL is not defined"

Make sure you set the secret:

```bash
wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL
```

For local development, create `.dev.vars`:

```
DATABASE_URL=your-connection-string
```

### "Cannot find module 'hono'"

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### "wrangler: command not found"

Install Wrangler globally:

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```
