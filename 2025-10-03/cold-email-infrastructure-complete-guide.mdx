## Cold Email Copywriting

### Proven Frameworks

#### 1. AIDA Framework (Most Popular)

**Structure:**
- **Attention**: Hook with subject line + opening that identifies specific problem
- **Interest**: Share specific solution approach
- **Desire**: Use social proof and results to create FOMO
- **Action**: Clear, compelling CTA

**Example:**
```
Subject: Quick question about [Company]'s [specific goal]

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is [specific observation from LinkedIn/news].
Most teams in your position struggle with [specific pain point].

We helped [Similar Company] achieve [specific result] in [timeframe]
by [brief solution approach].

Would a 15-minute call next week make sense to explore if we could
do something similar for [Company]?

[Your Name]
```

**Best For:** B2B sales, demo requests, meeting bookings

#### 2. PAS Framework (Problem-Agitate-Solve)

**Structure:**
- **Problem**: Identify the pain point
- **Agitate**: Make the problem feel urgent/costly
- **Solve**: Present your solution

**Example:**
```
Subject: Losing deals to competitors?

Hi [Name],

Most [Job Title]s struggle to [specific problem], which means
[consequence] and ultimately [bigger consequence].

Without [solution type], companies like yours typically
[negative outcome + quantify cost].

We've built [product] specifically to [solve problem]
in [unique way]. [Similar Company] saw [result] in [timeframe].

Want to see how it works? [CTA]
```

**Best For:** Pain-driven sales, urgent problems, competitive pressure

#### 3. BAB Framework (Before-After-Bridge)

**Structure:**
- **Before**: Paint current situation
- **After**: Show ideal future state
- **Bridge**: Explain how to get there

**Example:**
```
Subject: [Company] without [pain point]?

Hi [Name],

Right now: [Current painful situation at their company]

Imagine: [Ideal future state with specific benefits]

The bridge: [Your solution] helps you get there by [specific approach].
[Similar Company] went from [before metric] to [after metric] in [timeframe].

Quick 10-min call to show you how? [Calendar link]
```

**Best For:** Transformation stories, aspirational positioning

#### 4. 4P Framework (Picture-Promise-Proof-Push)

**Structure:**
- **Picture**: Describe relatable scenario
- **Promise**: What you'll deliver
- **Proof**: Social proof/data
- **Push**: Clear CTA with urgency

**Best For:** High-value offers, enterprise sales

### Subject Line Best Practices

**Length:** 30-50 characters optimal (mobile-friendly)

**High-Performing Patterns:**
- **Question:** "Quick question about [specific topic]" (37.5% open rate)
- **Personalization:** "[Name] - [benefit]"
- **Curiosity:** "This might be relevant for [Company]"
- **Direct Value:** "Increase [metric] by [%] in [timeframe]"

**Avoid:**
- ALL CAPS
- Excessive punctuation (!!!)
- Spam triggers: "FREE", "URGENT", "$$$", "Act now"
- Re: or Fwd: when not a reply
- Emoji overuse

**A/B Test Variables:**
- Personalization (name, company, role)
- Length (short vs descriptive)
- Curiosity vs clarity
- Question vs statement

### Email Body Structure

**Optimal Length:** 50-125 words (50% reply rate)

**Structure:**
1. **Opening (1 sentence):** Personalized observation or mutual connection
2. **Value Prop (2-3 sentences):** What you do, why it matters for them specifically
3. **Social Proof (1 sentence):** Brief result from similar company
4. **CTA (1 sentence):** Single, clear ask

**Personalization Requirements:**
- First name (minimum)
- Company name
- Specific trigger (recent news, funding, hiring, product launch)
- Industry-specific pain point
- 20%+ unique content per email

**Tone Guidelines:**
- **B2B:** Professional but conversational
- **C-Level:** Concise, results-focused, data-driven
- **Mid-Level:** Problem-solving, tactical benefits
- **Technical:** Feature-specific, integration details

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Generic Templates**
- "I came across your company online..."
- "I wanted to reach out because..."

✅ **Instead:** Specific observation or mutual connection

❌ **Over-Pitching**
- Feature lists
- Company history
- Self-focused language ("we", "our", "I")

✅ **Instead:** Customer-focused benefits (ROI, time saved, problem solved)

❌ **Multiple CTAs**
- "Let me know if you'd like a demo, or I can send you a case study, or we could schedule a call..."

✅ **Instead:** Single, specific ask with clear next step

❌ **Long-Winded**
- 300+ word emails
- Multiple paragraphs
- Complex explanations

✅ **Instead:** 50-125 words, scannable, mobile-friendly

### 2025 Copywriting Trends

**AI Detection Avoidance:**
- Avoid overly polished, corporate language
- Use contractions, casual phrasing
- Include minor imperfections (like humans)
- Vary sentence structure

**Hyper-Personalization:**
- Recent triggers (hiring, funding, product launch, news)
- Industry-specific pain points
- Technology stack mentions (from job postings)
- Growth stage tailoring

**Value-First Approach:**
- Lead with ROI/benefit, not features
- Specific numbers (% increase, time saved, cost reduction)
- Peer comparison ("companies like yours typically...")

## Email Sequences & Cadence

### Optimal Sequence Length

**Research-Backed Recommendation:** 3 emails per campaign

- **Email 1:** Initial outreach (37.5% of replies)
- **Email 2:** First follow-up (+31.5% of replies)
- **Email 3:** Breakup email (+17.7% of replies)

**Total Expected Reply Rate:** ~87% of all replies come from first 3 emails

**Extended Sequences (5-7 emails):** Only for high-value enterprise deals
- Diminishing returns: Email 4 adds only 8% more replies
- Risk: Increased unsubscribes and spam complaints

### Timing Between Emails

**Optimal Cadence:**
- **Day 1:** Initial email
- **Day 4:** First follow-up (+3 days)
- **Day 10:** Final breakup (+6 days)

**Alternative (Fibonacci):**
- Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, Day 5, Day 8, Day 13
- Mimics natural human persistence

### Best Days to Send

**Tuesday/Thursday:** Most effective (55% of studies)
- Tuesday: Highest open and reply rates
- Thursday: Second best, less competition

**Monday:** Avoid
- 20% open rate (lowest)
- 2.8% reply rate

**Wednesday:** Acceptable alternative

**Friday:** Avoid for B2B (executives planning weekend)

**Weekend:** Generally avoid, but test for specific industries

### Best Times to Send

**Early Morning (6-9 AM local time):**
- 25% higher reply rates for C-level executives
- Catches them at start of day
- Optimal: 7-8 AM PST

**Mid-Morning (10-11 AM):**
- Secondary peak for decision-makers
- After initial email triage

**Avoid:**
- Lunch hours (12-2 PM)
- End of day (4-6 PM)
- Late night

**Timezone Considerations:**
- Send based on recipient's timezone
- Use email scheduling tools
- Stagger sends across timezones (don't send all at once)

### Email Sequence Templates

#### Sequence 1: Demo/Meeting Request (B2B SaaS)

**Email 1 (Day 1) - Value Proposition:**
```
Subject: Quick question about [Company]'s [workflow]

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is [recent trigger: hiring, funding, launch].
Congrats on [specific achievement]!

Most [Job Title]s at companies your size struggle with [specific pain].
We've helped [Similar Company 1] and [Similar Company 2] achieve
[specific result] by [brief approach].

Would a 15-minute call next week make sense to explore if this
could work for [Company]?

[Your Name]

to a quick call to discuss how this could apply to [Company]?

[Calendar link]

[Your Name]
```

**Email 3 (Day 10) - Breakup:**
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'm assuming now's not the right time.

Before I close your file, I wanted to check one last time:
Is [solving specific pain] a priority for [Company] this quarter?

If not, no worries - I'll check back in [3-6 months].

[Your Name]
```

### Reply Detection & Automation

**Auto-Stop Rules:**
- **Positive Reply:** Stop sequence immediately, move to sales qualified lead
- **Out-of-Office:** Pause sequence, resume after return date
- **Not Interested:** Unsubscribe and tag as "not interested"
- **Unsubscribe:** Immediate removal from all sequences

**Sentiment Analysis:**
- **Positive:** "Yes", "interested", "let's chat", "sounds good"
- **Neutral:** "Tell me more", "send info", "what's the pricing"
- **Negative:** "Not interested", "remove me", "stop emailing"

**Best Practices:**
- Check for replies daily
- Respond within 4 hours (business hours)
- Personal response, not template
- Move out of automation immediately

### Multi-Channel Sequences

**Email + LinkedIn:**
- Day 1: Send email
- Day 2: View LinkedIn profile
- Day 4: Send LinkedIn connection request with note
- Day 7: Send follow-up email
- Day 10: LinkedIn message (if connected)

**Email + Phone:**
- Day 1: Send email
- Day 3: Phone call attempt #1
- Day 5: Follow-up email + voicemail reference
- Day 8: Phone call attempt #2
- Day 11: Final breakup email

**Effectiveness:** Multi-channel outreach increases reply rates by 30-40%

## Email Warming Strategy

### Why Email Warming Matters

**Sender Reputation Building:**
- ISPs track sender behavior over time
- New domains/IPs start with zero reputation
- High engagement early = long-term deliverability
- Poor start = blacklisting risk

**What ISPs Monitor:**
- Email volume patterns
- Recipient engagement (opens, clicks, replies)
- Spam complaints (<0.1% target)
- Bounce rates (<2% target)
- Authentication consistency

### Warming Timeline (14-30 Days)

**Week 1: Foundation (Days 1-7)**
- **Volume:** 5-20 emails/day
- **Increase:** +1-2 emails per day
- **Recipients:** High-engagement contacts only
- **Goal:** 50%+ open rate, 20%+ reply rate

**Week 2: Ramp-Up (Days 8-14)**
- **Volume:** 20-50 emails/day
- **Increase:** +5 emails per day
- **Recipients:** Expand to tier 2 contacts
- **Goal:** 40%+ open rate, 15%+ reply rate

**Week 3-4: Acceleration (Days 15-28)**
- **Volume:** 50-200 emails/day
- **Increase:** +10-20 emails per day
- **Recipients:** General cold outreach
- **Goal:** Maintain 25%+ open rate, 8%+ reply rate

**Month 2+: Production Volume**
- **Volume:** 200-500 emails/day per domain/account
- **Maintenance:** Continue warmup activities indefinitely
- **Monitoring:** Daily deliverability checks

### Manual Warming (DIY Approach)

**Phase 1: Internal Team (Days 1-7)**
1. Send emails to team members, friends, industry contacts
2. Ask them to open, reply, and forward
3. Varied content (not identical templates)
4. Natural conversation patterns

**Phase 2: High-Intent Prospects (Days 8-14)**
1. Target prospects who expressed interest before
2. Warm leads from networking, referrals
3. Personalized, value-first emails
4. High expected engagement

**Phase 3: Gradual Cold Outreach (Days 15+)**
1. Start with highly targeted lists
2. A+ prospects only (best-fit ICP)
3. Maximum personalization
4. Monitor metrics daily

### Automated Warming Services

- Service sends/receives emails with warming network
- Emails automatically opened, replied, marked important
- Gradual volume increase over 14-28 days
- Removes sent emails from inbox (hidden folders)

### Multiple Account Strategy

**Domain Rotation:**
- **Primary Domain:** yourdomain.com (for operations)
- **Sending Domains:** mail1.yourdomain.com, mail2.yourdomain.com, outreach.yourdomain.com
- **Isolation:** Cold email on subdomains to protect primary domain

**Account Pooling:**
- 10-20 sending accounts per domain
- Rotate sends across accounts
- Each account: 50-100 emails/day max
- Independent warming for each account

**Setup Example:**
```
mail1.yourdomain.com - 10 accounts (john1@, john2@, ... john10@)
mail2.yourdomain.com - 10 accounts (jane1@, jane2@, ... jane10@)
mail3.yourdomain.com - 10 accounts (mike1@, mike2@, ... mike10@)

Total: 30 accounts × 50 emails/day = 1,500 emails/day capacity
```

### Warming Best Practices

**✅ DO:**
- Start slow, increase gradually (10-20% per week)
- Maintain high engagement (reply to all warmup emails)
- Use varied content (don't send identical emails)
- Monitor deliverability daily
- Keep bounce rate <2%
- Aim for 0% spam complaints during warmup

**❌ DON'T:**
- Skip warmup (even aged domains need warming if inactive)
- Send to purchased lists during warmup
- Ignore bounce/complaint signals
- Ramp up too quickly (>20% increase/week)
- Stop warming after initial period (maintain ongoing)
- Use same template repeatedly

### Monitoring During Warmup

**Daily Checks:**
- Open rate (target 40%+ during warmup)
- Reply rate (target 20%+ during warmup)
- Bounce rate (<2%)
- Spam complaints (0%)
- Blacklist status (clean)

**Weekly Reviews:**
- Sender reputation score (Google Postmaster, SNDS)
- Deliverability trends
- Engagement patterns
- Volume increase schedule

**Red Flags:**
- Open rate drops below 20%
- Bounce rate above 2%
- Any spam complaints
- Blacklist appearance
- Delivery delays/failures

**If Red Flags Appear:**
1. Immediately reduce volume by 50%
2. Pause cold outreach
3. Increase engagement activities
4. Review authentication (SPF/DKIM/DMARC)
5. Check content for spam triggers
6. Validate email list quality
7. Resume cautiously after 3-5 days of improvement

## Technical Authentication

### SPF (Sender Policy Framework)

**What It Is:**
SPF authorizes which mail servers can send email on behalf of your domain.

**How It Works:**
1. You publish SPF record in DNS (TXT record)
2. Recipient server checks sender IP against SPF record
3. If IP is authorized, SPF passes
4. If not authorized, SPF fails (email may be rejected/spammed)

**SPF Record Structure:**
```
v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:sendgrid.net ip4:192.0.2.1 ~all
```

**Components:**
- `v=spf1` - SPF version
- `include:_spf.google.com` - Authorize Google Workspace servers
- `include:sendgrid.net` - Authorize SendGrid servers
- `ip4:192.0.2.1` - Authorize specific IP address
- `~all` - Soft fail for unauthorized servers (recommended)
- `-all` - Hard fail for unauthorized servers (strict)

**Setup Steps:**
1. List all email sending sources (Google Workspace, ESP, automation tools)
2. Gather SPF includes from each provider
3. Create single SPF TXT record at root domain
4. Test with `dig yourdomain.com TXT` or online SPF checker
5. Monitor for 24-48 hours before enforcement

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Multiple SPF records (only one allowed)
- ❌ More than 10 DNS lookups (hard limit)
- ❌ Forgetting automation tools (Zapier, webhooks, etc.)
- ❌ Using `-all` prematurely (blocks legitimate email)

**SPF Record Examples:**

**Google Workspace Only:**
```
v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all
```

**Google + SendGrid:**
```
v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:sendgrid.net ~all
```

**Google + Mailgun + Custom Server:**
```
v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:mailgun.org ip4:192.0.2.1 ~all
```

### DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)

**What It Is:**
DKIM adds a digital signature to emails, proving they haven't been tampered with.

**How It Works:**
1. Your email server signs outgoing emails with private key
2. You publish public key in DNS (TXT record at selector._domainkey.yourdomain.com)
3. Recipient server verifies signature using public key
4. If signature is valid, DKIM passes

**DKIM Record Structure:**
```
selector._domainkey.yourdomain.com TXT "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQC..."
```

**Components:**
- `selector` - Unique identifier (e.g., `google`, `mailgun`, `s1`)
- `v=DKIM1` - DKIM version
- `k=rsa` - Encryption type (RSA)
- `p=...` - Public key (long base64-encoded string)

**Setup Steps:**
1. Generate DKIM key pair (usually done by ESP)
2. Add private key to email sending server (ESP handles this)
3. Add public key TXT record to DNS at selector._domainkey.yourdomain.com
4. Test by sending email to [email protected] or similar
5. Verify DKIM signature in email headers

**Multiple DKIM Keys:**
Each ESP can have its own selector:
```
google._domainkey.yourdomain.com TXT "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=..."
sendgrid._domainkey.yourdomain.com TXT "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=..."
mailgun._domainkey.yourdomain.com TXT "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=..."
```

**DKIM Signing Example (Email Headers):**
```
DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; c=relaxed/relaxed;
    d=yourdomain.com; s=google;
    h=from:to:subject:date:message-id;
    bh=frcCV1k9oG9oKj3dpUqdJg1PxRT2RSN/XKdLCPjaYaY=;
    b=GJPvvOdo12nYXCG...
```

### DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)

**What It Is:**
DMARC tells recipient servers what to do with emails that fail SPF and/or DKIM checks.

**How It Works:**
1. You publish DMARC policy in DNS (TXT record at _dmarc.yourdomain.com)
2. Recipient checks SPF and DKIM alignment
3. If both fail, recipient follows your DMARC policy (none/quarantine/reject)
4. Recipient sends aggregate reports to your specified email

**DMARC Record Structure:**
```
_dmarc.yourdomain.com TXT "v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:[email protected]; pct=100"
```

**Components:**
- `v=DMARC1` - DMARC version
- `p=none` - Policy (none/quarantine/reject)
- `rua=mailto:...` - Aggregate report email
- `ruf=mailto:...` - Forensic report email (optional)
- `pct=100` - Percentage of emails to apply policy (100% = all)
- `sp=quarantine` - Subdomain policy (optional)
- `adkim=r` - DKIM alignment mode (r=relaxed, s=strict)
- `aspf=r` - SPF alignment mode (r=relaxed, s=strict)

**DMARC Policies:**

1. **p=none** (Monitoring Only)
   - No action on failed emails
   - Collect reports only
   - **Use this first!** (2-4 weeks minimum)
   - Identifies configuration issues

2. **p=quarantine** (Move to Spam)
   - Failed emails go to spam/junk
   - Recommended for most domains
   - Monitor reports before enabling

3. **p=reject** (Block Completely)
   - Failed emails are rejected
   - Strictest policy
   - Only use after weeks of clean reports

**DMARC Implementation Timeline:**

**Week 1-4: Monitoring**
```
v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:[email protected]; pct=100
```
- Collect reports
- Identify legitimate senders
- Fix SPF/DKIM issues

**Week 5-8: Soft Enforcement**
```
v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:[email protected]; pct=25
```
- Apply quarantine to 25% of emails
- Monitor for false positives
- Gradually increase pct to 100%

**Week 9+: Full Enforcement**
```
v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:[email protected]; pct=100
```
- All failing emails quarantined
- Protect against spoofing
- Optional: Move to p=reject after clean reports

**DMARC Report Analysis:**
Reports arrive daily as XML attachments. Use DMARC analyzer tools:
- Dmarcian (free tier available)
- Postmark DMARC Digests (free)
- DMARC Analyzer by OnDMARC

**Key Metrics to Monitor:**
- SPF pass rate (target 100%)
- DKIM pass rate (target 100%)
- DMARC pass rate (target 100%)
- Sources sending email on your behalf
- Any spoofing attempts

### DNS Configuration

**Required Records:**

1. **MX Records** (Mail Exchange):
```
yourdomain.com MX 10 mail.yourdomain.com
yourdomain.com MX 20 mail2.yourdomain.com
```

2. **A Record** (For mail server):
```
mail.yourdomain.com A 192.0.2.1
```

3. **PTR Record** (Reverse DNS):
```
1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa PTR mail.yourdomain.com
```

4. **SPF Record**:
```
yourdomain.com TXT "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all"
```

5. **DKIM Records**:
```
google._domainkey.yourdomain.com TXT "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=..."
sendgrid._domainkey.yourdomain.com TXT "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=..."
```

6. **DMARC Record**:
```
_dmarc.yourdomain.com TXT "v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:[email protected]"
```

## Deliverability Optimization

### List Hygiene

**Email Validation Process:**

1. **Pre-Send Validation:**
   - Syntax check (valid email format)
   - Domain verification (DNS MX record exists)
   - Mailbox verification (mailbox exists and accepts mail)
   - Catch-all detection (flags risky domains)
   - Disposable email detection (remove temporary emails)
   - Role-based email detection (info@, sales@, support@)
   - Spam trap detection

2. **Validation Frequency:**
   - New lists: Validate 100% before first send
   - Existing lists: Re-validate every 3-6 months
   - High-bounce addresses: Validate immediately
   - Inactive contacts (6+ months): Validate before re-engagement

**Email Validation Services:**

| Service | Accuracy | Speed | Pricing | Best For |
|---------|----------|-------|---------|----------|
| **ZeroBounce** | 99.6% | 45 min (100K emails) | $20/2K credits | Full deliverability suite |
| **NeverBounce** | 99.9% | 2-10 min (10K emails) | $8/1K credits | Fast bulk validation |
| **Hunter.io** | 95%+ | Real-time | $49/month (1K) | Email finding + validation |
| **Clearout** | 98%+ | 10-20 min (10K) | $14/1K credits | Budget option |

**Validation Result Actions:**

- **Valid:** Send ✅
- **Invalid:** Remove immediately ❌
- **Catch-All:** Segment separately, send cautiously ⚠️
- **Role-Based:** Remove or segment (lower engagement) ⚠️
- **Disposable:** Remove ❌
- **Spam Trap:** Remove immediately ❌
- **Unknown:** Re-validate or remove after 30 days ❌

### Content Optimization

**Spam Trigger Words to Avoid:**

**Financial:**
- Free, Cash, $$$, Money, Income, Profit, Guarantee, Credit

**Urgency:**
- Act Now, Limited Time, Urgent, Hurry, Expires, Deadline

**Promises:**
- 100% Free, No Risk, Results Guaranteed, Miracle, Amazing

**Suspicious:**
- Click Here, Dear Friend, Congratulations, You've Won

**Alternatives:**
- Instead of "Free": "Complimentary", "No cost", "On us"
- Instead of "Act Now": "Available today", "This week only"
- Instead of "Guaranteed": "Proven", "Validated", "Tested"

**HTML vs Plain Text:**

**Plain Text (Recommended for Cold Email):**
- ✅ Higher deliverability
- ✅ Feels more personal/human
- ✅ Less spam filter triggers
- ✅ Better for B2B
- ❌ No branding
- ❌ No tracking pixels (by default)

**HTML:**
- ✅ Better branding
- ✅ Tracking pixels for opens
- ✅ Clickable buttons
- ❌ Higher spam score
- ❌ Slower load times
- ❌ Rendering issues across clients

**Best Practice:** Plain text with simple formatting (line breaks, no images)

**Link Best Practices:**
- Maximum 1-2 links per email
- Use branded short links (link.yourdomain.com, not bit.ly)
- Descriptive anchor text (not "Click here")
- HTTPS only
- Avoid link shorteners (bit.ly, tinyurl = spam)

**Image Guidelines:**
- Avoid images in cold email (spam trigger)
- If needed: 1 small image (<100KB), 80:20 text-to-image ratio
- Always include alt text
- Host on your domain, not third-party

### Engagement Optimization

**Engagement Metrics ISPs Track:**
- **Opens** - Read vs ignored
- **Clicks** - Engaged vs passive
- **Replies** - Highest signal of interest
- **Forwards/Shares** - Viral indicator
- **Time to open** - Immediate vs delayed
- **Read time** - Quick scan vs full read

**Strategies to Boost Engagement:**

1. **Target High-Intent Prospects:**
   - Recent triggers (hiring, funding, product launch)
   - Active on LinkedIn (posting, commenting)
   - Visited your website
   - Engaged with content before
   - Mutual connections

2. **Personalization at Scale:**
   - First line customization (specific to each person)
   - Industry-specific pain points
   - Company-specific observations
   - Role-based messaging
   - Technology stack mentions

3. **Send Time Optimization:**
   - Test different times for your audience
   - Use recipient's timezone
   - Early morning (7-9 AM) for executives
   - Mid-morning (10-11 AM) for managers

4. **Subject Line Testing:**
   - A/B test every campaign
   - Track open rates by subject pattern
   - Iterate based on data

5. **Content Relevance:**
   - Match message to recipient's current priorities
   - Reference recent company news
   - Address timely pain points
   - Provide immediate value

### Technical Optimizations

**Email Headers:**

**Required Headers:**
```
From: John Doe <[email protected]>
Reply-To: [email protected]
List-Unsubscribe: <https://yourdomain.com/unsubscribe?id=abc123>
List-Unsubscribe-Post: List-Unsubscribe=One-Click
Precedence: Bulk
```

**List-Unsubscribe (Required in 2025):**
- Must be one-click unsubscribe (RFC 8058)
- Must process within 2 days
- Gmail/Yahoo requirement for bulk senders

**Precedence: Bulk:**
- Signals to ISPs that this is marketing/outreach email
- Helps with proper filtering
- Required for DMARC compliance in some cases

**Custom Headers (Optional but Helpful):**
```
X-Campaign-ID: campaign_123
X-Mailer: YourPlatform v1.0
X-Priority: 3 (Normal)
```

**Email Client Rendering:**

Test rendering across:
- Gmail (web, iOS, Android)
- Outlook (desktop, web, mobile)
- Apple Mail (macOS, iOS)
- Yahoo Mail
- Proton Mail

**Tools:**
- Litmus ($99/month) - Comprehensive testing
- Email on Acid ($45/month) - Rendering + spam testing
- PutsMail (free) - Basic rendering test

### ISP-Specific Strategies

**Gmail (Google Workspace):**
- Use Google Postmaster Tools for monitoring
- Target <0.10% spam rate
- Prioritize engagement (opens, replies)
- Authenticate with SPF + DKIM + DMARC
- Avoid promotional tab triggers (subject line "Free", "Discount")

**Outlook/Microsoft 365:**
- Use Microsoft SNDS for monitoring
- Maintain clean IP reputation
- Avoid attachments (security filters)
- Use plain text over HTML
- Monitor complaint rates closely

**Yahoo:**
- Similar to Gmail requirements
- More aggressive spam filtering
- Higher authentication requirements
- Monitor Complaint Feedback Loop

// Multi-ESP sender
class EmailInfrastructure {
  private mailgun: Mailgun.Client
  private ses: SESClient
  private espWeights = { mailgun: 0.6, ses: 0.4 }

  async send(email: Email): Promise<void> {
    const esp = this.selectESP()

    switch(esp) {
      case 'mailgun':
        return this.sendViaMailgun(email)
      case 'ses':
        return this.sendViaSES(email)
    }
  }

  private selectESP(): 'mailgun' | 'ses' {
    return Math.random() < this.espWeights.mailgun ? 'mailgun' : 'ses'
  }

  private async sendViaMailgun(email: Email) {
    await this.mailgun.messages.create('yourdomain.com', {
      from: email.from,
      to: email.to,
      subject: email.subject,
      text: email.body,
      'o:tracking': 'yes',
      'o:tracking-clicks': 'yes'
    })
  }

  private async sendViaSES(email: Email) {
    const command = new SendEmailCommand({
      Source: email.from,
      Destination: { ToAddresses: [email.to] },
      Message: {
        Subject: { Data: email.subject },
        Body: { Text: { Data: email.body } }
      }
    })
    await this.ses.send(command)
  }
