## 1. Product Hunt Strategy

### Overview
Product Hunt is the leading platform for discovering new products, with 24-hour upvoting periods that determine daily rankings. Success requires careful preparation, community engagement, and post-launch follow-up.

### Pre-Launch Preparation (3+ Weeks Before)

**Timing Requirements:**
- Start preparation **at least 3 weeks before launch**
- Build audience of **400+ people** before launching
- Quality of upvotes from active PH members > quantity

**Pre-Launch Community Building:**
- Engage with the community by upvoting and commenting on other products
- Build credibility before your launch
- Identify key contributors or hunters who might support your launch
- Study past launches and comments to analyze what worked
- Look for patterns in successful products

### Launch Day Best Practices

**Optimal Timing:**
- **Launch at 12:01 AM PST** - gives full 24 hours before leaderboard resets
- **Tuesday-Thursday** - mid-week engagement is higher than Monday/Friday
- Avoid weekends and major holidays

**Hunter Selection (Updated 2025):**
- Product Hunt **no longer sends email notifications** to hunters' followers
- PH now suggests you **hunt your own product** to save time
- Partnering with well-known hunter still beneficial for credibility
- Choose hunter with expertise in your product category if possible

**Launch Day Execution:**
- Share link on social media platforms
- Email your list (segment for PH announcement)
- Post in Slack communities and forums
- Ask early supporters to upvote and engage
- **Actively answer questions** in comments section
- Have 2-3 team members on standby for questions
- Batch responses in 2-hour intervals

**Content Strategy:**
- Clear, compelling title (avoid superlatives)
- Professional product images/GIFs
- Concise description highlighting key value props
- Demo video (highly recommended)
- Link to GitHub repo (for open source)

### Post-Launch Follow-Up (24-48 Hours)

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Thank Supporters**
   - Send follow-up email sharing results
   - Thank everyone who engaged or upvoted
   - Build goodwill for future launches

2. **Continue Engagement**
   - Respond to additional comments/questions
   - Stay professional even with critical feedback
   - Acknowledge bugs/issues with fix timeline

3. **Analyze Results**
   - Review traffic, sign-ups, feedback
   - Track conversion metrics
   - Document lessons learned

### Long-Term Follow-Up Strategy

**User Communication:**
- Send thank-you emails summarizing feedback
- Share updates about new features and milestones
- Highlight how user feedback was incorporated
- Show commitment to continuous improvement

**Leverage Feedback:**
- Use feedback to enhance product
- Communicate changes to users
- Build community around improvements

**Repurpose Content:**
- Use PH launch assets in other campaigns
- Create blog posts or case studies
- Share "Product of the Day" badge

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Spamming for upvotes
❌ Neglecting to engage with commenters
❌ Launching without adequate preparation
❌ Becoming defensive about criticism
❌ Failing to follow up with users
❌ Not analyzing results for future launches

### Expected Results

**Metrics to Track:**

## 2. Hacker News Show HN Strategy

### Overview
Hacker News (HN) is a highly technical community that values substance over marketing. Show HN posts appear on a dedicated "show" tab, allowing longer visibility than the main page. The community responds best to genuine builder-to-builder communication.

### Title Best Practices

**Format:**
- **Use "Show HN:" prefix** - appears on "show" tab (less competitive)
- Make title **direct and specific** - get straight to the point
- Crystal clear and explicit - obvious what you've built
- If "open-source alternative to X", say it in the title

**Language Guidelines:**
- **DON'T use superlatives:** "fastest, biggest, first, best"
- **Modest language is stronger** - let the work speak for itself
- Avoid marketing-speak and hyperbole
- Be descriptive without selling

**Examples of Strong Show HN Titles:**
- ✅ "Show HN: Deploy servers close to your users"
- ✅ "Show HN: Dropbox - Throw away your USB drive"
- ✅ "Show HN: Meteor, a realtime JavaScript framework"
- ✅ "Show HN: Open-source alternative to [Product]"
- ❌ "Show HN: The fastest, most revolutionary deployment tool"
- ❌ "Show HN: Best developer platform you've ever seen"

### Content Strategy

**Link Destination:**
- For **technical products**: Link to **GitHub repo** (not landing page)
- Your **README is your landing page** on HN
- Repo demonstrates transparency and technical depth
- Landing page link can go in comments

**Description/Comments:**
- **Talk to HN as fellow builders** - imagine chatting with an engineer friend
- Go deep into technical details - community is genuinely curious
- Explain architecture, design decisions, trade-offs
- Be honest about limitations and challenges
- Share what you learned building it

**Tone:**
- Write for highly technical audience who see through marketing
- Don't sell - **interest them, let them sell themselves**
- If you try to sell, they'll close the tab
- Act like you're having a drink with a former coworker

### Open Source Positioning

**Why HN Loves Open Source:**
- Community **overindexes on open-source, privacy-first products**
- Transparency and code quality matter
- GitHub stars and community engagement signal quality

**Optimization for Open Source:**
- Ensure README is comprehensive and well-formatted
- Include architecture diagrams, examples, quick-start guide
- Document installation, configuration, usage clearly
- Add contribution guidelines and code of conduct
- Make issues and PRs visible and welcoming

### Timing Considerations

**Best Times:**
- **Earlier in the week** (Tuesday-Wednesday) shows better results
- Avoid Friday afternoon/evening (people checking out)
- Morning PST can work well for US-based audience
- Test different times based on your target geography

**Visibility Strategy:**
- Show HN tab gives **longer visibility** than main page
- Posts stay visible longer than 24-hour PH cycle
- Can gather upvotes over extended period
- Less competitive than main HN front page

### Community Engagement

**Comment Response Strategy:**
- **Engage actively** with post comments
- Main benefit is feedback from experienced audience
- Don't hold back on harsh feedback - you need it as a founder
- **When criticized, act like critics are doing you a favor**
- You won't convince the critic, but you can convince the audience reading it

**Product Setup:**
- **Track who's adopting your product** after launch
- Many people will try it out during HN traffic spike
- Have analytics ready for signup attribution
- Create HN-specific landing page or parameter if possible

### Handling Criticism Professionally

**Response Framework:**
1. **Acknowledge the feedback:** "Thanks for this perspective"
2. **Explain context if needed:** "Here's why we made this choice..."
3. **Show willingness to improve:** "We're considering this for v2"
4. **Stay humble:** "You're right, this is a limitation"
5. **Don't argue:** Move on after one response

**What NOT to Do:**
- ❌ Become defensive or argumentative
- ❌ Dismiss valid technical concerns
- ❌ Use marketing language in responses
- ❌ Over-explain or make excuses
- ❌ Ignore criticism completely

### Expected Results

**Metrics to Track:**
- Upvotes and front-page time
- GitHub stars and watchers
- Direct traffic to repo/site
- Issues and PRs opened
- Community engagement quality
- Technical discussions spawned

**Success Indicators:**
- Multiple pages of substantive comments
- Technical questions about implementation
- Feature requests and use-case discussions
- Other devs sharing similar experiences
- Follow-up blog posts or discussions referencing your post

## 3. DEV.to / Hashnode / Medium Syndication

### Overview
Content syndication across developer platforms can **increase reach by 300-500%** without harming SEO when executed properly. The key is using canonical URLs to maintain SEO authority on your own domain while distributing content across community platforms.

### Canonical URL Strategy

**Core Principle:**
- **Publish on your own domain FIRST**
- Wait **2-10 days** (depending on Google crawl frequency)
- **Then submit to third-party sites** with canonical URL pointing to original
- Platforms act as **distribution nodes, not content owners**
- No duplicate content penalties when done correctly

**Expected Results:**
- 85% higher engagement rates than single-platform publishing
- 300-500% increase in total reach
- SEO authority remains on your domain
- Search engines know where the "real" article lives

### Platform-Specific Setup

#### Hashnode

**Canonical URL Support:**
- ✅ **Best for maintaining SEO authority** - allows canonical URL to point to your domain
- Preferred platform for publishing while keeping authority on your site
- Custom domain support for Hashnode blogs

**Publishing Workflow:**
1. Publish on your domain first
2. Wait for Google to crawl (check Search Console)
3. Create Hashnode post with canonical URL to your domain
4. Hashnode community discovers via their platform
5. SEO credit goes to your domain

**Features:**
- Clean, developer-focused interface
- RSS feed support (your-blog.hashnode.dev/rss.xml)

2. Scroll to "Publishing to DEV Community from RSS"
3. Add your Hashnode RSS: `your-blog.hashnode.dev/rss.xml`
4. ✅ Check "Mark the RSS source as canonical URL"
5. DEV pulls all articles as Drafts immediately
6. Properly detects already imported posts (no duplicates)
