# AI-Native Software Reimagination - Execution Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-03
**Status:** Infrastructure Setup - Week 1, Day 1
**Phase:** 1 (Scraping Preparation)

---

## What We're Building

A massive-scale AI transformation engine that:

1. **Scrapes** 50,000+ software products from 10+ sources (G2, Capterra, Product Hunt, HN, GitHub, etc.)
2. **Analyzes** each product using 100 parallel AI agents to reimagine as AI-native services
3. **Integrates** with O*NET occupational database (1,000+ occupations) to map products to jobs
4. **Generates** complete service definitions with MCP schemas, pricing models, and documentation
5. **Deploys** all 50,000 services automatically to Cloudflare infrastructure

**Timeline:** 24 weeks (6 months)
**Cost:** ~$1,350/month
**Output:** 50,000 AI-native, usage-based, agent-centric services

## Architecture Overview

### Data Flow

```
Sources (G2, Capterra, etc.)
    ↓ (58 parallel scrapers)
Queue (batching, retry logic)
    ↓
Queue Processor
    ↓
R2 Storage (NDJSON → Parquet)
    ↓
Analysis Agents (100 parallel)
    ↓

```

### Agent Orchestration

**Master Orchestrator:** LangGraph state machine
- Coordinates all 5 phases
- Checkpoints progress to database
- Handles failures and retries

**Phase Executors:** CrewAI teams
- Scraping Team: 58 workers
- Analysis Teams: 20 teams × 5 agents = 100 agents
- O*NET Team: 20 agents
- Content Team: 200 agents
- Deployment Team: 30 agents

**Total: 378 parallel workers/agents**

## Key Schemas

### Product Schema (Phase 1)
```typescript
interface Product {
  id: string
  source: 'g2' | 'capterra' | '...'
  name: string
  category: string
  description: string
  pricing: Pricing
  features: string[]
  reviews: Review[]
  // ... 30+ fields
}
```

### AI-Native Service Schema (Phase 2)
```typescript
interface AINativeService {
  id: string
  originalProductId: string
  name: string
  jobToBeDone: JobToBeDone
  mcp: MCPSpecification // tools, resources, prompts
  pricing: UsageBasedPricing // pay-per-action/outcome
  architecture: Architecture // Cloudflare Workers
  capabilities: Capabilities // autonomous, real-time, etc.
  migration: MigrationGuide
  automationPotential: number
  // ... complete service definition
}
```

### MCP Specification
```typescript
interface MCPSpecification {
  version: '2025-03-26'
  tools: MCPTool[] // 20-50 per service
  resources: MCPResource[] // 10-30 per service
  prompts: MCPPrompt[] // 5-15 per service
}
```

- **Data quality** → Multi-source validation, human sampling
- **AI hallucinations** → Schema validation, deterministic checks
- **Scaling issues** → Gradual rollout, auto-scaling

### Legal
- **Web scraping** → Public data only, respect ToS
- **IP concerns** → Transformative use, no trademark infringement
- **Data privacy** → No PII, GDPR compliant

### Business
- **Market validation** → MVP for top 100 first
- **Competition** → Open source strategy, first-mover advantage
