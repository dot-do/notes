### 2. GitHub Profile
- Make sure your GitHub profile is professional
- Add clear bio
- Pin relevant repositories
- Show activity (not abandoned account)

### 3. Description Formula
```
[Service Name] provides [core capability] for [target audience].
Built on [tech stack] for [key benefit].

Example:
embeddings.do provides real-time text embeddings for developers.
Built on Cloudflare Workers for sub-50ms global latency.
```

### 4. Follow Up Timing
- Wait 2 weeks before gentle ping
- Check if maintainer is active on GitHub recently
- Look for patterns in PR merge times
- Some lists are slower than others

### 5. Batch Similar Submissions
- Do all Node.js lists together (fresh context)
- Do all AI/ML lists together
- Do all API lists together
- Reuse polished descriptions across similar lists
