#### Maker's Comment

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Nathan from .do, and I'm excited to share **api.do** - our production API gateway running on Cloudflare Workers!

**The Backstory:**
We had a 4MB monolithic application that was becoming impossible to maintain. We wanted microservices, but traditional approaches (Kubernetes, service mesh, load balancers) seemed more complex than our monolith. We asked: "Can we get microservices benefits without the operational nightmare?"

**The Answer: Yes (with Cloudflare Workers + Workers RPC).**

**What is api.do?**
api.do is a pure gateway that routes incoming HTTP requests to 30+ specialized microservice workers. Each service is small (200-500 lines), focused, and independently deployable. The gateway handles:
- ✅ Domain-based routing
- ✅ JWT authentication (WorkOS)
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ CORS handling
- ✅ Request validation

**What Makes It Different?**
1. **Workers RPC = Game Changer:** Type-safe service communication with sub-10ms latency. No API contracts, no serialization overhead. If it compiles, it works.
2. **Global by Default:** Deploy once, runs in 300+ cities. Users in Tokyo and London both get sub-50ms response times.
3. **Zero Infrastructure:** No Kubernetes, no Docker, no AWS console. Just `wrangler deploy`.
4. **Ridiculously Cheap:** $5/10M requests vs. $500+ on AWS Lambda + RDS + CloudFront.

**Our Current Architecture:**
- **@api/gateway** (1,349 LOC) - Routes requests
- **@db/database** (1,909 LOC) - PostgreSQL/ClickHouse access
- **@auth/authentication** (2,669 LOC) - WorkOS SSO, API keys, RBAC

### Service 3: db.do - Database Layer

#### Headline
**"db.do - Type-safe database layer for Cloudflare Workers"** (57 chars)

#### Tagline
**"PostgreSQL + ClickHouse at the edge with Drizzle ORM and sub-50ms queries."** (77 chars)

#### Description

**The Problem:**
Cloudflare Workers can't maintain persistent database connections. Traditional ORMs don't work. HTTP-based database APIs add latency. Managing credentials across 30+ workers is a security nightmare.

**Our Solution:**
db.do is a type-safe database layer that centralizes all database access in a single RPC service. Uses Drizzle ORM for compile-time type safety, Neon for serverless PostgreSQL, and ClickHouse for analytics. Every worker accesses the database via Workers RPC with sub-10ms latency.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Dual Database:** PostgreSQL (OLTP) + ClickHouse (OLAP)
- **Type Safety:** Drizzle ORM with full TypeScript inference
- **Workers RPC:** Sub-10ms database access from any service
- **Zero Connection Management:** No pooling, no credentials in workers
- **Automatic Migrations:** drizzle-kit generates and applies migrations
- **Free Tier:** 10GB storage, 1M queries/month

Perfect for developers who want database access without infrastructure complexity.

#### Maker's Comment

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Nathan from .do, and today I'm sharing **db.do** - our type-safe database layer for Cloudflare Workers!

**The Backstory:**
Cloudflare Workers can't maintain persistent database connections (they're stateless). We tried:
- ❌ HTTP-based database APIs (added 50-100ms latency)
- ❌ Connection pooling services (expensive, complex)
- ❌ Storing credentials in every worker (security nightmare)

We needed a better way to do database access at the edge.

**The Solution: Centralize Everything in One RPC Service**

**What is db.do?**
db.do is a single Workers service that:
1. Maintains database connections (PostgreSQL + ClickHouse)
2. Exposes type-safe RPC methods
3. Handles connection pooling automatically
4. Provides zero-latency access via Workers RPC

**Every other service calls db.do via RPC:**
```typescript
// In any worker
const user = await env.DB_SERVICE.getUser('123')
//    ^? User type is fully inferred!
```

**Why This Architecture Works:**
1. **Type Safety:** Drizzle ORM generates types from schema
2. **Sub-10ms Latency:** Workers RPC is faster than HTTP
3. **Security:** Only @db/ has database credentials
4. **Simplicity:** Workers don't manage connections
5. **Consistency:** Single source of truth for data access

**Dual Database Strategy:**
- **PostgreSQL (Neon):** Transactional data (users, content, config)
- **ClickHouse:** Analytics (logs, metrics, time-series)
- **Right tool for the right job!**

**Schema-First Development:**
1. Define schema in TypeScript (Drizzle)
2. Generate migration: `drizzle-kit generate`
3. Apply migration: `drizzle-kit migrate`
4. Deploy @db/ service: `wrangler deploy`
5. All workers get updated types automatically!

**Production Results:**
- 📊 1M+ database queries/day
- ⚡ 45ms average query latency (P50)
- 💰 $25/month (Neon PostgreSQL)
- 🗄️ 15GB data, growing 1GB/month
- ✅ Zero connection errors in 6 months

**Features:**
- ✅ Type-safe queries with Drizzle ORM
- ✅ Automatic schema migrations
- ✅ PostgreSQL for OLTP workloads
- ✅ ClickHouse for OLAP analytics
- ✅ Connection pooling handled automatically
- ✅ Query logging and performance monitoring
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (68%)

**Data Importers Included:**
- CSV import from R2
- JSON import from APIs
- Schema inference from sample data
- Bulk insert optimization
- Validation with Zod schemas

### Service 4: ai.do - AI Services

#### Headline
**"ai.do - Unified AI integration for text, embeddings, and chat"** (59 chars)

#### Tagline
**"One API for OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and Workers AI - switch providers with one config change."** (97 chars)

#### Description

**The Problem:**
Every AI provider has different SDKs, authentication, rate limits, and error handling. Building production AI requires managing multiple providers, handling fallbacks, tracking costs, caching prompts, streaming responses, and ensuring reliability. Most apps hard-code OpenAI and get vendor-locked.

**Our Solution:**

**Key Benefits:**
- **Multi-Provider:** OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Workers AI, 50+ models
- **Zero Vendor Lock-in:** Switch providers with one config change
- **Intelligent Routing:** Route by cost, latency, or capabilities
- **Streaming Support:** Real-time responses with ReadableStream
- **Prompt Caching:** 90% cost savings on repeated prompts
- **Free Tier:** 100K tokens/month (~150K words)

Perfect for developers building production AI applications without vendor lock-in.

#### Maker's Comment

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Nathan from .do, and I'm excited to share **ai.do** - our unified AI integration layer!

**The Problem:**
Every AI provider is different:
- OpenAI: Great for GPT-4, expensive
- Claude: Best for reasoning, different API
- Gemini: Fast and cheap, different SDK
- Workers AI: Free but limited models

Building production AI means:
- ❌ Managing 4+ different SDKs
- ❌ Handling different auth methods
- ❌ Different rate limits per provider
- ❌ No automatic fallbacks
- ❌ Vendor lock-in (hard to switch)
- ❌ Manual cost tracking

**What if there was one API for everything?**

**Introducing ai.do:**
```typescript
// One interface, any provider
const result = await ai.generate({
  prompt: "Explain quantum computing",
  model: "gpt-4" // or "claude-3.5-sonnet" or "gemini-1.5-pro"
})
```

**Switch providers without code changes:**
```typescript
// Just change config, code stays the same
model: "gpt-4"       → $0.06 per 1K tokens
model: "claude-3.5"  → $0.015 per 1K tokens (4x cheaper!)
model: "gemini-flash" → $0.0001 per 1K tokens (600x cheaper!)
```

**Intelligent Routing:**
- **Cost-based:** Use cheapest model that meets requirements
- **Latency-based:** Use fastest model
- **Quality-based:** Use GPT-4 for complex, GPT-3.5 for simple
- **Automatic Fallback:** Switch to secondary if primary fails

**Key Features:**

### Service 5: llm.do - LLM Integration Hub

#### Headline
**"llm.do - Type-safe LLM integration with structured outputs"** (57 chars)

#### Tagline
**"Access 50+ LLMs with Zod-validated structured outputs, streaming, and function calling."** (90 chars)

#### Description

**The Problem:**
LLM responses are unpredictable. You ask for JSON, you get markdown. You define a schema, the LLM ignores it. Parsing and validating LLM outputs is fragile and error-prone. Building production AI requires structured, validated, type-safe outputs every time.

**Our Solution:**
llm.do provides type-safe LLM integration with Zod schema validation. Define your expected output schema, llm.do ensures the LLM follows it and validates the result. Automatic retries if validation fails. Full TypeScript type inference.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Structured Outputs:** Define Zod schemas, get validated data
- **50+ LLMs:** GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, and more
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript inference from schemas
- **Streaming:** Real-time responses with partial validation
- **Function Calling:** Tools with automatic execution
- **Free Tier:** 50K tokens/month

Perfect for developers building production AI that requires reliable, structured data.

#### Maker's Comment

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Nathan from .do, and I'm thrilled to share **llm.do** - type-safe LLM integration with structured outputs!

**The Frustration:**
You've been there:
```typescript
// You: "Return JSON with name and age"
const result = await llm.generate(prompt)
// LLM: "Sure! Here's the JSON:\n```json\n{name: 'Alice', age: 30}\n```"
// You: 😭 Now I have to parse markdown, fix quotes, validate...
```

**What if LLMs just returned typed, validated data?**

**Introducing llm.do:**
```typescript
import { llm } from '@dot-do/llm'
import { z } from 'zod'

// Define what you want
const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  age: z.number()
})

// Get exactly what you want
const person = await llm.generate(prompt, { schema })
//    ^? { name: string, age: number }
```

**How It Works:**
1. You define a Zod schema
2. llm.do generates JSON schema for the LLM
3. LLM generates response
4. llm.do validates with Zod
5. If invalid, llm.do retries with error feedback
6. You get fully typed, validated data

**Key Features:**

**1. Structured Outputs:**
```typescript
const recipe = await llm.generate("Create a recipe", {
  schema: z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    ingredients: z.array(z.string()),
    steps: z.array(z.string()),
    cookTime: z.number()
  })
})
// Guaranteed valid!
```

**2. Streaming with Type Safety:**
```typescript
const stream = await llm.generateStream(prompt, { schema })
for await (const chunk of stream) {
  console.log(chunk.name) // Partial validation!
}
```

**3. Function Calling:**
```typescript
const tools = {
  search: z.function()
    .args(z.object({ query: z.string() }))
    .returns(z.array(z.string()))
}

const result = await llm.generate(prompt, { tools })
// LLM automatically calls tools when needed!
```

**4. Intelligent Routing:**
```typescript
// Route based on cost, quality, or capabilities
const result = await llm.generate(prompt, {
  model: "cheapest", // or "fastest" or "best"
  schema: complexSchema
})
```

**Supported Models (50+):**
- OpenAI: GPT-4, GPT-3.5, GPT-4o
- Anthropic: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Opus, Haiku
- Google: Gemini 1.5 Pro, Flash
- Open Source: Llama 3.1, Mistral, Command R+
- And more via Fireworks, Together, Replicate, Groq

**Production Stats:**
- 📊 1M+ structured generation requests/month
- ✅ 95% first-attempt validation success rate
- 💰 70% cost reduction with intelligent routing
- ⚡ 800ms average time to first token
- 🎯 100% TypeScript type coverage

**Real Use Cases:**
1. **Data Extraction:** PDFs → Structured database records
2. **Form Generation:** Natural language → Validated forms
3. **API Responses:** Reliable JSON for client apps
4. **Content Classification:** Text → Typed categories
5. **Code Generation:** Prompts → Valid TypeScript

**Why It's Better:**
- ❌ OpenAI SDK: No schema validation (you do it manually)
- ❌ LangChain: Complex, heavy, schema support limited
- ✅ llm.do: Built for structured outputs from day 1

**Try It:**

#### Maker's Comment

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Nathan from .do, and today I'm sharing **auth.do** - enterprise authentication for B2B SaaS!

**The B2B Auth Problem:**
Enterprise customers say:
- "We need Google SSO"
- "We need SAML for Okta"
- "We need directory sync (SCIM)"
- "We need audit logs for compliance"
- "We need MFA enforcement"

You say:
- 😰 "That's 6 months of work"
- 😰 "We need to pass SOC 2"
- 😰 "Security vulnerabilities scare me"
- 😰 "Maintaining this is a full-time job"

**What if enterprise auth was just... easy?**

**Introducing auth.do:**
Built on WorkOS (the auth platform used by thousands of B2B companies), auth.do gives you:

**1. SSO in Minutes:**
```typescript
// That's it. No OAuth flow, no tokens, no headaches.
const session = await env.AUTH_SERVICE.validateSession(token)
```

**Supported Providers:**
- ✅ Google OAuth
- ✅ GitHub OAuth
- ✅ Microsoft OAuth
- ✅ SAML 2.0 (Okta, OneLogin, Azure AD, etc.)
- ✅ Magic Links (passwordless)
- ✅ Multi-factor authentication

**2. Directory Sync (SCIM):**
- User provisioning when employees join
- Automatic deprovisioning when employees leave
- Group/team sync
- Profile updates propagate automatically

**3. API Key Management:**
```typescript
const apiKey = await env.AUTH_SERVICE.createAPIKey({
  userId: user.id,
  scopes: ['read', 'write'],
  expiresIn: '90d'
})
```

Features:
- Automatic rotation (30/60/90 days)
- Scoped permissions
- Rate limiting per key
- Revoke instantly
- Audit trail

**4. Session Management:**
- Encrypted cookies (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
- Automatic token refresh
- Rolling sessions (extend on activity)
- Device tracking
- Force logout from all devices

**5. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):**
```typescript
// Define roles
const roles = {
  admin: ['*'], // Full access
  editor: ['posts.create', 'posts.update'],
  viewer: ['posts.read']
}

// Check permissions
await env.AUTH_SERVICE.requirePermission('posts.write')
```

**6. Audit Logging:**
Every auth event logged:
- User login (IP, device, location)
- Failed login attempts
- API key created/rotated/revoked
- Permission granted/revoked
- SSO configured
- SAML connection added

Stored in ClickHouse for long-term retention.

**Production Results:**
- 👥 5,000+ monthly active users
- 🔑 10,000+ API keys managed

#### Maker's Comment

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Nathan from .do, and I'm excited to share **sdk.do** - our 121-package TypeScript SDK ecosystem!

**The SDK Problem:**
Most platforms give you:
- ❌ One giant SDK (slow, heavy)
- ❌ Many small SDKs (inconsistent, hard to discover)
- ❌ No AI framework integration (manual glue code)

Product Hunt has a "Hunter" system where established community members can "hunt" (feature) products. Products hunted by well-known hunters get:
- ✅ Instant credibility
- ✅ Higher visibility in feeds
- ✅ More initial upvotes
- ✅ Better chance of #1-10 ranking

**Pro Tip:** You can hunt your own product, but having a hunter with an established following is advantageous.

api.do - Production API gateway for Cloudflare Workers - Launching on Product Hunt today!

Hey r/SideProject! 👋

I just launched api.do on Product Hunt today and wanted to share with this community that's given me so much inspiration!

**What is api.do?**
api.do is a production-ready API gateway that routes HTTP requests to 30+ microservice workers running on Cloudflare's global edge network. Built for developers who want microservices without Kubernetes complexity.

**The Problem I Was Solving:**
I had a 4MB monolithic app that was impossible to maintain. I wanted microservices, but traditional approaches (K8s, service mesh, load balancers) were more complex than my monolith. I needed microservices benefits without operational nightmares.

**How It Works:**
- Gateway routes requests based on domain/path
- 30+ specialized services (database, AI, auth, email, etc.)
- Workers RPC for sub-10ms typed service communication
- Zero infrastructure management (just deploy and run)
- Global by default (300+ cities)

**The Tech Stack:**
- Cloudflare Workers (V8 isolates, no cold starts)
- Workers RPC (typed service bindings)
- Drizzle ORM (PostgreSQL via Neon)
- TypeScript (100% type safety)
- Hono (fast HTTP router)

**Stats:**
- Development time: 6 months
- Lines of code: ~13,000 (8 core services)
- Cost to run: $30/month (vs. $520/month on AWS)
- Performance: 45ms P50 latency, 10M requests/day

**What's Next:**
- Real-time observability dashboard
- Community-contributed services
- Auto-scaling per service

**Try It:**
- Website: https://api.do?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=sideproject&utm_campaign=ph-launch
- Product Hunt: https://producthunt.com/posts/api-do

I'd love your feedback! What features would make this more useful for your projects?

Ask me anything about:
- Microservices architecture
- Cloudflare Workers
