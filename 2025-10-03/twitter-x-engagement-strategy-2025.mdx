## 4. Algorithm Insights: How the "For You" Feed Works

### Three Main Feeds in 2025

1. **Following** - Chronological feed of accounts you follow
2. **For You** - Algorithm-driven mixed feed (main discovery feed)
3. **Explore** - Trending content and topics

### How the Algorithm Works

**Four-Stage Process:**

1. **Candidate Sourcing** - Gathers potential tweets from:
   - In-Network sources (accounts you follow)
   - Out-of-Network sources (accounts you don't follow)

2. **Ranking** - Scores content based on prediction models for engagement likelihood

3. **Heuristics & Filters** - Applies rules to ensure content diversity and quality

4. **Mixing & Serving** - Blends In-Network and Out-of-Network content into final feed

### Key Ranking Signals

**Primary Factors:**

1. **Engagement Metrics** - Weighted by type:
   - **Likes:** 30x algorithmic boost
   - **Retweets:** 20x algorithmic boost
   - **Replies:** 1x algorithmic boost
   - Total engagement volume matters most

2. **User Behavior History:**
   - Past likes, shares, follows
   - Topic and Community activity
   - Time spent on similar content

3. **Recency:**
   - Algorithm still values fresh content
   - Not strictly chronological but rewards timeliness
   - First 2-3 hours critical for initial engagement

4. **Content Sources:**
   - In-Network content ranked by engagement predictions
   - Out-of-Network content must meet higher quality bar
   - Community and Topic participation influences what you see

5. **Account Authority:**
   - Verified/Premium accounts get preferential placement
   - Consistent engagement history
   - Account age and follower quality

### What Boosts Reach in 2025

**High-Impact Actions:**
- **Replies and conversations** - Algorithm prioritizes discussion over passive consumption
- **Quick initial engagement** - First hour performance predicts overall reach
- **Native content** - Platform-specific content over external links
- **Premium/Verified status** - 3x engagement boost reported
- **Trending alignment** - Content matching trending topics gets visibility boost
- **Native features** - Using polls, Spaces, long-form posts

**What Hurts Reach:**
- External links (especially to competitors)
- Generic/low-effort content
- Excessive hashtags (3+)
- Starting tweets with hashtags or mentions
- Spam-like behavior patterns
- Violations of community guidelines

### 2025 Algorithm Updates

- **AI-powered customization** coming in 2025 (users can ask Grok to customize feed)
- **Open source updates** every 2 weeks
- **Increased emphasis on verified accounts** in For You feed
- **More sophisticated engagement prediction** models

### Metric Interpretation Best Practices

**Context Matters:**
- Don't chase vanity metrics
- Understand why numbers changed
- Compare periods consistently
- Segment by content type
- Track trends over time
- Focus on engagement rate over absolute numbers

**Red Flags:**
- Sudden drop in engagement (possible shadowban)
- High impressions but low engagement (content quality issue)
- Follower growth without engagement growth (bot followers)
- Declining engagement rate trend (algorithm penalty or content fit)
