## Deployment Checklist

### Step 1: Create .github Repository (15 minutes)

**Purpose:** GitHub displays a special repository named `.github` as the organization profile.

**Instructions:**

1. **Create the repository:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to GitHub web interface
   # Go to: https://github.com/organizations/dot-do/repositories/new

   Repository name: .github
   Description: Organization profile and community health files
   Visibility: Public ‚úÖ (must be public)
   Initialize: Do NOT add README, .gitignore, or license (we have our own)
   ```

2. **Clone the repository locally:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Projects
   git clone git@github.com:dot-do/.github.git
   cd .github
   ```

3. **Copy files from .do root:**
   ```bash
   # From /Users/nathanclevenger/Projects/.do/
   cp .github-profile-README.md ~/.../Projects/dot-do/.github/README.md
   cp .github-CONTRIBUTING.md ~/Projects/dot-do/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md
   cp .github-CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md ~/Projects/dot-do/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
   cp .github-SECURITY.md ~/Projects/dot-do/.github/SECURITY.md
   cp .github-SUPPORT.md ~/Projects/dot-do/.github/SUPPORT.md
   ```

4. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Projects/dot-do/.github
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add organization profile and community health files"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Verify deployment:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/dot-do
   - Profile README should appear immediately
   - All files should be visible in repository

**Expected Result:** Organization profile page shows comprehensive README with branding, architecture, stats, and links.

---

### Step 2: Update Organization Settings (30 minutes)

**Purpose:** Optimize GitHub organization metadata for discoverability.

**Instructions:** See companion document `notes/2025-10-03-github-org-settings-guide.md` for detailed step-by-step instructions.

**Quick Overview:**
1. Organization display name ‚Üí "dot-do"
2. Organization description ‚Üí "AI-Native Infrastructure for Modern APIs"
3. Organization URL ‚Üí https://do.com (or https://github.com/dot-do/.do)
4. Organization email ‚Üí contact@do.com
5. Twitter ‚Üí @dotdo_ai (when available)
6. Organization location ‚Üí "Global"
7. Profile picture ‚Üí .do logo (1024x1024px PNG)

---

### Step 3: Pin 6 Key Repositories (15 minutes)

**Purpose:** Showcase most important repositories on organization profile.

**Recommended Pinned Repositories (in order):**

1. **.do (root)** - Multi-repo architecture and documentation hub
2. **workers** - 8 production microservices (100% complete)
3. **sdk** - 121 TypeScript SDK packages
4. **mdx** - MDX runtime and content infrastructure
5. **api** - Hono-based API service (Cloudflare Workers)
6. **db** - Database layer (Drizzle, PostgreSQL, pgvector)

**Instructions:**

1. Go to: https://github.com/dot-do
2. Click "Customize your pins" button (below profile README)
3. Select the 6 repositories listed above
4. Drag to reorder (top-left = most important)
5. Click "Save pins"

**Verification:**
- Pinned repos appear in 2x3 grid on profile
- Order matches strategic importance
- All 6 have stars/forks visible

**Alternative Pinning Strategy (if needed):**
- If user feedback suggests different priorities, swap out:
  - **packages** (shared npm packages monorepo)
  - **site** (public websites with Next.js)
  - **agent** (Durable Objects AI agent)

---

### Step 4: Optimize Pinned Repository Metadata (45 minutes)

**Purpose:** Ensure pinned repositories have compelling descriptions and topics.

**For Each Pinned Repository:**

#### .do (root)

Topics: drizzle-orm, postgresql, database, migrations, pgvector, cloudflare-d1
Website: https://db.docs.do (when GitHub Pages deployed)
```

**How to Update Each Repo:**

1. Go to repository settings
2. Update "Description" field
3. Update "Website" field
4. Add "Topics" tags (press Enter after each)
5. Ensure "Releases" and "Packages" are enabled
6. Save changes

**Expected Result:** All pinned repos have:
- Clear, keyword-rich descriptions
- 5-8 relevant topic tags
- Website URLs (placeholder until GitHub Pages deployed)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Profile README Not Showing

**Solution:**
1. Verify repository name is exactly `.github` (lowercase)
2. Verify repository is public
3. Verify README.md is in root of repository
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for GitHub cache to update
5. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Issue: Community Health Files Not Applying Org-Wide

**Context:** Files in `.github` repository apply to all org repos without these files.

**Solution:**
1. Verify files are in root of `.github` repository
2. Verify files have correct names (all caps, .md extension)
3. Individual repos can override by adding their own files
4. Wait 10-15 minutes for GitHub to sync

### Issue: Discussions Link Not Working

**Solution:**
1. Verify Discussions are enabled on .do repository (not .github)
2. Use correct URL: https://github.com/orgs/dot-do/discussions
3. If 404 error, enable Discussions in .do repo settings

### Issue: Pinned Repositories Not Showing

**Solution:**
1. Verify repositories are public
2. Verify organization member has permission to pin repos
3. Maximum 6 repositories can be pinned
4. Try unpinning and re-pinning
