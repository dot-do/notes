**What This Means:**

**Strategy Mix:**
- **Broad hashtags:** #DigitalMarketing, #Technology, #Innovation
- **Niche-specific:** #ContentMarketingTips, #B2BSaaS, #AIInHealthcare

**Placement Options:**
1. End of post (most common)
2. Integrated naturally within text
3. First comment (keeps post clean)

**Formatting:**

## 4. Algorithm Insights

### How the LinkedIn Algorithm Works (2025)

#### Three-Stage Content Filtering Process

**Stage 1: Quality Classification**
When you publish a post, LinkedIn immediately categorizes it:

1. **Spam** ‚Üí Suppressed immediately
   - Excessive tags
   - Banned words
   - Suspicious links
   - Posting too frequently

2. **Low-Quality** ‚Üí Limited visibility
   - Lacks engagement potential
   - Poor formatting
   - Irrelevant content
   - Engagement bait detected

3. **High-Quality** ‚Üí Higher chance of feed placement
   - Well-structured
   - Professional tone
   - Contributes value
   - Original insights

**Stage 2: Initial Engagement Testing**
- Post shown to small percentage of your audience (~10%)
- Algorithm evaluates first-hour performance ("The Golden Hour")
- Measures:
  - Likes and reactions
  - Comments (especially quality comments)
  - Shares and reposts
  - Click-through rates
  - **Dwell time** (how long people read)

**Stage 3: Expanded Distribution**
- If initial engagement is strong ‚Üí broader distribution
- Post shown to immediate network
- Then extended network (2nd-degree connections)
- High-performing content ‚Üí shown to non-connections

Problem or bold statement

[LINE BREAK]

Why it matters

[LINE BREAK]

[VALUE/INSIGHTS]
‚Ä¢ Key point 1

[LINE BREAK]

[CALL-TO-ACTION]
Question or discussion prompt
```
