### Platform Overview

**Positioning:** Independent review platform selling intent data to vendors
**Audience:** Startups and US market (high perceived quality)
**Traffic:** Millions of software buyers researching solutions
**Business Model:** Intent data sales, not click-based advertising

### Profile Claiming & Setup

**Claiming Process:**
1. Search for your product on G2.com
2. Click "Claim this profile" if listing exists

**Market Presence Score Components:**

- **Web Presence** - Moz domain authority
- **Web Traffic** - SEMrush estimated traffic metrics
- **Company Age** - Maturity and stability indicators

**2025 Award Eligibility Changes:**
- ❌ No longer requires 50+ reviews for awards

**Review Authentication:**

### Review Generation Tactics

**Timing:**

### Category Optimization

**Strategy:**
- List in 3-7 most relevant categories (primary + adjacent)
- Focus review collection on primary category
- Track Grid position monthly (Leaders, High Performers, Contenders, Niche)
- Monitor competitor movement and review velocity

**Functional Product Lists:**
- A product's percentage of categories within a functional list affects scoring
- Reviews earned within functional list categories weighted higher
- Example: Marketing automation reviews matter more for Marketing functional list

**Category Research Process:**
1. Analyze competitor category placements
2. Review customer use case descriptions
3. Check Grid report eligibility (10+ reviews minimum)
4. Prioritize high-traffic categories
5. Balance between achievable ranking and category size

### Buyer Intent Data Strategy

**Intent Signals G2 Captures:**

- **Sponsored Content Visits** - Users on competitor pages with your ads
- **Category Page Visits** - Users browsing relevant software categories
- **Competitor Page Visits** - Direct comparison research
- **Alternative Page Visits** - Users examining alternatives

**As of June 2022:** G2 reports **Buying Stage** and **Activity Level** instead of singular Buyer Intent score.

**Sales Applications:**
- Prioritize outreach to high-intent accounts
- Focus on prospects actively comparing solutions
- Personalize messaging based on viewed competitors
- Time outreach based on research activity level

**Marketing Applications:**
- Target ads to accounts showing intent

- Build ABM campaigns around intent clusters

**Customer Success Applications:**
- Identify customers researching competitors (churn risk)
- Detect customers exploring new categories (upsell opportunity)

## 2. Gartner Digital Markets Strategy (Capterra, GetApp, Software Advice)

### Platform Overview

**Ownership:** All three platforms owned by Gartner Digital Markets
**Shared Infrastructure:** Same review catalog across all three
**Audience:** Capterra targets SMBs globally with highest traffic
**Business Model:** PPC (pay-per-click) advertising model
**Annual Reach:** 100M buyers across all platforms + UpCity

### Key Platform Differences

| Platform | Primary Audience | Geographic Focus | Traffic Volume |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Capterra** | SMBs | Global | Highest |
| **GetApp** | SMBs | US & Europe | Medium |
| **Software Advice** | SMBs | US | Medium |
| **UpCity** | Service Providers | US | Growing |

**Important:** One review submitted = appears on all four platforms automatically.

### Single Dashboard Management

**Gartner Digital Markets Dashboard:**

- View consolidated review metrics
- Configure PPC campaigns across platforms
- Track performance by platform and geography
- Access buyer engagement data
- Respond to reviews centrally

**Setup Process:**
1. Create vendor account at Gartner Digital Markets
2. Claim existing listings (if present)
3. Complete unified profile (propagates to all platforms)
4. Configure platform-specific settings (optional)
5. Set up PPC campaigns per platform
6. Establish review collection workflows

### PPC Model and Bidding

**How PPC Works:**
- Pay only when buyers click on your listing
- Bid on categories, not keywords
- Define bids per platform (Capterra, GetApp, Software Advice)
- Set geographic targeting and budgets
- Adjust bids based on conversion performance

**Bidding Strategy:**
- **Aggressive Bids:** High-intent categories where you convert well
- **Moderate Bids:** Adjacent categories for brand awareness
- **Low Bids:** Exploratory categories for testing

**Country-Specific Bidding:**
- US market typically most expensive
- International markets often lower CPCs
- Adjust bids based on sales team coverage
- Consider customer LTV by geography

**Budget Optimization:**
- Start with $500-1,000/month per platform (test budget)

- Monitor competitor bidding activity

**Sponsored Profile Features:**

### Category-Based Review Distribution

**Critical Insight:** Reviews are attributed to specific categories based on feature mentions.

**How It Works:**

4. Total reviews ≠ reviews per category

**Example Scenario:**
- Product has 1,000 total reviews
- Only 50 mention "marketing automation" features
- Rank last in Marketing Automation category despite high total count
- Need category-specific review collection

**Category Optimization Tactics:**
1. **Review Request Targeting:**
   - Segment users by features they actively use
   - Request reviews from marketing automation users for that category
   - Guide reviewers to mention specific capabilities

2. **Review Form Completion:**
   - Encourage detailed, feature-rich reviews
   - Provide talking points about specific functionalities
   - Highlight categories you want to rank in

3. **Category Selection:**
   - List in 5-10 most relevant categories
   - Focus review collection on top 3 priority categories
   - Monitor category-specific review distribution

## Review Collection Strategy (Universal Best Practices)

### Timing for Asking Customers

**Optimal Timing Windows:**

1. **Post-Onboarding (1-2 weeks):**
   - User has experienced core value
   - Initial friction resolved
   - Success milestone achieved
   - Excitement and momentum present

2. **Post-Success Event:**
   - Project completion
   - Goal achievement (ROI realized)
   - Problem solved
   - Expansion or renewal decision

3. **Quarterly Campaigns:**
   - Regular cadence to engaged users
   - Segment by product usage and satisfaction
   - Target power users and champions
   - Avoid over-soliciting same users

4. **After Positive Support Interaction:**
   - Problem successfully resolved
   - Feature request implemented
   - Positive feedback received
   - Relationship strengthened

**Timing to Avoid:**
- During onboarding (too early, limited experience)
- Immediately after purchase (no usage yet)
- During support issues or escalations
- Within 30 days of previous review request
- During contract negotiations or renewals

**General Rule:** Give customers 1-2 weeks (simple products) to 1-3 months (complex products) to experience value before requesting reviews.

### Incentive Programs

**Allowed Incentives:**

1. **Non-Conditional Rewards:**
   - Amazon gift cards ($25-50 range)

**Required Disclosures:**
- ✅ "We're offering a $25 gift card for your time and honest feedback"
- ✅ "As a thank you for completing this review, you'll receive..."
- ❌ "Leave us a 5-star review and get a gift card"
- ❌ "Positive reviews will be entered into a drawing"

**FTC Compliance:**
