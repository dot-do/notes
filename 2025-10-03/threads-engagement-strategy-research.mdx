## 1. Optimal Posting Times & Frequency

### Best Times to Post (Data from 700K+ Posts)

**Peak Performance Time:**
- **7 AM Wednesday** - Absolute best time across all days
- **Weekday mornings (7-9 AM)** - Consistently high engagement
- **Surprisingly: 1 AM Sunday** - Also a top performer

**Best Times by Day of Week:**

**For Established Presence:**
- **1-3 posts per day** for consistent engagement
- **3-5 posts per week** minimum for most users
- **Quality over quantity** - better results with 1-2 high-quality daily posts

**Key Insight:** "Frequency beats perfection" - Consistent posting outperforms occasional polished content.

## 3. Hashtag & Discovery Strategy

### How Hashtags Work on Threads (2025)

**Major Shift: Topic Tags vs. Traditional Hashtags**

Threads has evolved from traditional hashtags to **Topic Tags**:
- **No # symbol required** (automatically removed)
- **Multiple words supported** (unlike traditional hashtags)
- **One tag per post** (strategic limitation)
- **Tag view = Search view** (improved discoverability)

### How to Use Topic Tags

**Adding Tags:**
1. Click the # symbol when composing
2. Start typing your topic
3. Select from existing tags or create new with "+ Tag new topic"
4. Tag appears in blue text without the # symbol

**Strategic Usage:**
- Use relevant, trending tags to increase reach
- Avoid spam behavior with excessive tagging
- Research popular tags in your niche
- Join established community conversations

### Discovery Features (2025)

**Search & Discovery Tools:**
- **Topic-based search** - Find posts by subject matter
- **Trending conversations** - Algorithm surfaces popular discussions
- **Following tab** - Chronological feed of followed accounts
- **For You tab** - Algorithmic recommendations
- **Communities (New!)** - 100+ topic-based communities launched October 2025

### Communities Feature (October 2025)

**Major Platform Update:**
- **100+ communities** covering popular topics (NBA, Books, Tech, K-pop, etc.)
- **Custom Like emojis** - Each community has unique reactions (e.g., book stack for Book Threads)
- **Dedicated feeds** - View posts within specific communities
- **Profile badges** - Display community memberships publicly
- **Future feature:** Special badges for top contributors

**How to Leverage Communities:**
- Join relevant communities in your niche
- Post directly to communities without topic tags
- Engage actively to build contributor status
- Cross-promote between main feed and communities

### Cross-Post Hashtag Handling

**Instagram Cross-Posts:**
- Threads now **hides hashtags** from Instagram cross-posts
- Hashtags appear behind "Show hashtags" CTA
- Keeps feeds cleaner and more authentic
- Reduces spam appearance
