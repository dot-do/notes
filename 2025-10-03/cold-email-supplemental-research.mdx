Send initial cold email to prospect
```

**Day 2: LinkedIn Profile View**
```
View prospect's LinkedIn profile
(Shows up in their "Who's Viewed Your Profile")
```

**Day 4: LinkedIn Connection Request**
```
Send personalized connection request with note:
"Hi [Name], I sent you an email about [topic] - thought it
would be great to connect here as well. [Your Name]"
```

**Day 7: Follow-up Email**
```
Send follow-up email referencing LinkedIn connection
```

**Day 10: LinkedIn Message (if connected)**
```
If they accepted connection, send brief LinkedIn message
```

**Day 14: Final Breakup Email**
```
Final email attempt
```

**Result:** 30-40% higher response rates than email-only

---

#### Email + Phone Sequence

**Day 1: Email**
```
Send initial cold email
```

**Day 3: Phone Call #1**
```
Call prospect, leave voicemail if no answer:
"Hi [Name], [Your Name] from [Company]. I sent you an email
about [topic] - wanted to follow up quickly. Call me back
at [number] or hit reply to my email. Thanks!"
```

**Day 5: Email #2 + Reference Call**
```
"Hi [Name], I tried calling you earlier about [topic].
If now's not the right time, just let me know..."
```

**Day 8: Phone Call #2**
```
Second call attempt, leave voicemail referencing email
```

**Day 11: Final Breakup Email**
```
Final email attempt
```

**Result:** Faster responses, especially for urgent/high-value deals

---

#### Email + SMS Sequence

**Day 1: Email**
```
Send initial cold email
```

**Day 4: Follow-up Email**
```
Standard follow-up
```

**Day 7: SMS**
```
Short SMS (70 characters or less):
"Hi [Name], did you get my email about [topic]?
Worth a quick chat? - [Your Name]"
```

**Day 10: Email + SMS Reference**
```
"Hi [Name], following up on my text from [day].
If you're interested in [benefit], let's chat..."
```

**Result:** SMS converts 21-30% (vs. 2-5% email alone)

**SMS Best Practices:**

- Keep ultra-short (<70 characters ideal)
- Professional but conversational

### What Works in 2025

**✅ Effective Tactics:**
1. **Micro-personalization:** First line references specific detail from prospect's profile/company
2. **Recent triggers:** Funding, hiring, product launch, news mention
3. **Social proof:** Name-drop similar companies (competitors or peers)
4. **Short emails:** 50-125 words
5. **Single CTA:** One clear ask, not multiple options
6. **Follow-ups:** 3 email minimum, 2-7 day spacing
7. **Optimal timing:** Tuesday/Thursday, 7-9 AM recipient timezone
8. **Small batches:** <100 recipients per campaign for max personalization

**❌ What Doesn't Work:**
1. **Generic templates:** "I came across your company..."
2. **Long emails:** 300+ words
3. **Feature dumps:** Listing product features
4. **Multiple CTAs:** "Let me know if you'd like a demo, or I can send a case study, or..."
5. **Hype language:** "Revolutionary", "Game-changing", "Transform your business"
6. **Immediate selling:** Pitching product in first email
7. **No follow-ups:** One-and-done emails
8. **Spray-and-pray:** Sending to unqualified lists

Did I catch you at an okay time?"

[Value Prop - 15 seconds]
"We help [companies like theirs] achieve [specific result].
Recent client [Similar Company] saw [metric]."

[Question]
"Are you currently [handling X process] in-house,
or working with a partner?"

[Listen, then pivot to meeting]
"Makes sense. Would it be worth 15 minutes next week
to show you how we helped [Similar Company]?"
```
