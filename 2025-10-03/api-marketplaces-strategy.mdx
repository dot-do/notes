### 4.2 Authentication Documentation

**Requirements:**

1. **Supported Methods:**
   - API Key
   - Bearer Token (JWT)
   - OAuth 2.0
   - Basic Authentication
   - Custom authentication

2. **Documentation for Each Method:**
   ```markdown
   ## Authentication

   ### API Key Authentication

   Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header:

   ```bash
   curl -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key_here" \
     https://api.example.com/v1/users
   ```

   **Obtaining an API Key:**
   1. Sign up at https://example.com/signup
   2. Navigate to Developer Dashboard
   3. Click "Create API Key"
   4. Copy and secure your key

   **Security Best Practices:**
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Rotate keys regularly (90 days recommended)
   - Use environment variables for key storage
   - Implement key rotation without downtime

   ### OAuth 2.0

   Authorization Code Flow for web applications:

   **Step 1:** Redirect user to authorization URL:
   ```
   https://example.com/oauth/authorize?
     client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&
     redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&
     response_type=code&
     scope=read write
   ```

   **Step 2:** Exchange code for access token:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://example.com/oauth/token \
     -d "grant_type=authorization_code" \
     -d "code=AUTH_CODE" \
     -d "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID" \
     -d "client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
   ```

   **Step 3:** Use access token in requests:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     https://api.example.com/v1/users
   ```
   ```

3. **Token Lifecycle:**
   - Token expiration times
   - Refresh token flow
   - Token revocation process

4. **Error Handling:**
   - 401 Unauthorized
   - 403 Forbidden
   - Invalid token errors
   - Expired token handling

---

### 4.3 Rate Limiting Documentation

**Requirements:**

1. **Rate Limit Details:**
   ```markdown
   ## Rate Limits

   API requests are limited per API key:

   | Plan | Requests/Hour | Requests/Day |
   |------|--------------|--------------|
   | Free | 100 | 1,000 |
   | Basic | 1,000 | 10,000 |
   | Pro | 10,000 | 100,000 |
   | Enterprise | Custom | Custom |

   ### Rate Limit Headers

   Every API response includes rate limit information:

   ```
   X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
   X-RateLimit-Remaining: 997
   X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
   ```

   - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Total requests allowed per hour
   - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining in current window
   - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: UTC timestamp when limit resets

   ### Handling Rate Limits

   When you exceed the rate limit, the API returns HTTP 429:

   ```json
   {
     "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
     "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Try again in 1843 seconds.",
     "retry_after": 1843
   }
   ```

   **Best Practices:**
   - Cache responses when possible
   - Implement exponential backoff for retries
   - Monitor `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header
   - Distribute requests throughout the hour
   - Use webhooks instead of polling
   ```

2. **OpenAPI Specification:**
   - Define rate limit headers in components
   - Document 429 response
   - Include Retry-After header

---

### 4.4 Error Handling Documentation

**Requirements:**

1. **Standard Error Response Format:**
   ```json
   {
     "error": {
       "code": "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND",
       "message": "User with ID '123' not found",
       "details": {
         "resource_type": "user",
         "resource_id": "123"
       },
       "timestamp": "2025-10-03T14:30:00Z",
       "request_id": "req_abc123xyz"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **HTTP Status Codes:**
   ```markdown
   | Code | Meaning | Description |
   |------|---------|-------------|
   | 200 | OK | Request succeeded |
   | 201 | Created | Resource created successfully |
   | 400 | Bad Request | Invalid request parameters |
   | 401 | Unauthorized | Authentication required |
   | 403 | Forbidden | Insufficient permissions |
   | 404 | Not Found | Resource not found |
   | 422 | Unprocessable Entity | Validation errors |
   | 429 | Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded |
   | 500 | Internal Server Error | Server error |
   | 503 | Service Unavailable | Temporary outage |
   ```

3. **Error Codes Catalog:**
   - Document all custom error codes
   - Provide resolution guidance
   - Include examples for each error type

4. **Validation Errors:**
   ```json
   {
     "error": {
       "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
       "message": "Request validation failed",
       "details": {
         "errors": [
           {
             "field": "email",
