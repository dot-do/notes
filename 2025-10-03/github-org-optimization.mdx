```

**Design Principles:**
- **Microservices-First** - Small, focused services (200-500 LOC each)
- **RPC Communication** - Workers RPC (Service Bindings) for inter-service calls
- **Protocol Agnostic** - Every function exposed via RPC, REST, MCP, and Queue handlers
- **Database Isolation** - Only @db/ talks to PostgreSQL
- **Gateway Pattern** - @api/ routes requests, doesn't implement logic

## Part 3: GitHub Pages Documentation Architecture

### 3.1 Strategic Approach

**Why GitHub Pages = Highest SEO Value:**
1. **Full Indexing** - Unlike repository READMEs, Pages sites are indexed like any website
2. **Custom Domains** - Can use *.do domains for branding and authority building
3. **Sitemap Support** - Automatic sitemap generation with Jekyll/static site generators
4. **Meta Tag Control** - Full control over title, description, Open Graph tags
5. **Fast Load Times** - Static site CDN = Core Web Vitals optimization
6. **Search Console** - Can verify and submit to Google Search Console

**Research Evidence:**
- From GitHub SEO research: "GitHub Pages CAN rank in Google search results"
- Competitor analysis: Stripe, Vercel, Supabase all use Pages extensively
- DA inheritance: Pages sites benefit from github.io DA 95+

### 3.4 Custom Domain Setup

**Recommended Domain Strategy:**

| Site | Custom Domain | Purpose |
|------|---------------|---------|
| Root Docs | do.com | Main developer hub |
| MDX Docs | mdx.do | MDX format specification |
| Packages | packages.do | NPM registry browser |
| Schemas | schemas.do | Schema explorer |
| Integrations | integrations.do | Integration directory |

**Setup Process:**

1. **Configure DNS (Cloudflare):**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: @
Content: dot-do.github.io
Proxy: Yes (orange cloud)
```

2. **Add Custom Domain in GitHub:**
```bash
# In repository settings:
# Pages → Custom domain → Enter domain
# Wait for DNS check to pass
# Enable "Enforce HTTPS"
```

3. **Update Site Config:**
```javascript
// docusaurus.config.js
url: 'https://mdx.do',
baseUrl: '/',
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Professional branding (.do domains)
- ✅ SSL/TLS automatic (GitHub provides)
- ✅ Cloudflare CDN (fast global access)
- ✅ Custom domain authority (builds SEO)
- ✅ Google Search Console verification (possible with custom domain)

### 3.5 Deployment Workflow

**GitHub Actions for Auto-Deploy:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml
name: Deploy Documentation

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'pnpm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install

      - name: Build site
        run: pnpm run build

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./build
          cname: mdx.do
```

**Result:**
- Automatic deployment on every push to main
- Preview builds for pull requests
- Custom domain maintained
- Fast builds (~2-3 minutes)

## Conclusion & Next Steps

Subagent B3 Complete: GitHub Organization Optimization delivered to notes/2025-10-03-github-org-optimization.md

**Key Recommendations:**

• **Start with profile README immediately** - Zero-cost, high-impact change that establishes professional brand presence and appears instantly on github.com/dot-do

• **Deploy mdx.do GitHub Pages within 14 days** - Highest SEO value per research, comprehensive MDX docs already exist, and custom domain ready (mdx.do available)

• **Enable GitHub Discussions and standardize community templates across all 57 repos** - Creates engagement channels and establishes contribution pathways before content marketing scales
