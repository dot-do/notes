## General Questions

### What is .do?

.do is an AI-native infrastructure platform for building modern API applications. It provides:
- 8 production microservices on Cloudflare Workers
- 121 domain-specific TypeScript SDKs
- Zero-config deployment to global edge network
- AI-first architecture with MCP, LangChain, Vercel AI SDK support

### Is .do open source?

Yes! Most of our repositories are open source under the MIT License. See individual repositories for specific licenses.

### Is .do free to use?

Yes, .do is free and open source. Deployment costs depend on your Cloudflare plan:
- **Free tier:** 100,000 requests/day
- **Paid plans:** Starting at $5/month for 10M requests/month

### Who is behind .do?

.do is built by a team of developers passionate about developer experience, edge computing, and AI integration. See our [Team page](link).

---

## Getting Started

### How do I get started with .do?

1. **Install the SDK:**
   ```bash
   npm install @dot-do/api-client
   ```

2. **Make your first API call:**
   ```typescript
   import { ApiClient } from '@dot-do/api-client'

   const client = new ApiClient({ apiKey: process.env.DOT_DO_API_KEY })
   const result = await client.ai.generate({ prompt: 'Hello!' })
   ```

3. **Deploy a microservice:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dot-do/workers.git
   cd workers/gateway
   pnpm install
   pnpm run deploy
   ```

4. Read the [full guide](https://docs.do/getting-started)

### What are the prerequisites?

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm 8+
- Cloudflare account (for deployment)
- Basic TypeScript knowledge

### Where can I find examples?

Check out our [examples directory](https://github.com/dot-do/.do/tree/main/examples) with full working projects.

---

## Architecture

### What is the microservices architecture?

.do uses 8 small, focused microservices instead of one large monolith:
- **gateway/** - API routing, auth, rate limiting
- **db/** - Database abstraction (PostgreSQL/Neon + ClickHouse)
- **auth/** - Authentication (WorkOS, API keys, RBAC)
- **schedule/** - Cron jobs and scheduled tasks
- **webhooks/** - External webhook handlers
- **email/** - Transactional emails (Resend)
- **mcp/** - Model Context Protocol server
- **queue/** - Message queue processing

Each service is independently deployable and scalable.

### Why Cloudflare Workers?

- **Global edge network:** Deploy to 300+ cities worldwide
- **Zero cold starts:** Instant execution
- **Cost effective:** Free tier + pay-as-you-go
- **Built-in scalability:** Automatic scaling
- **Modern runtime:** V8 isolates, not containers

### What database does .do use?

We use PostgreSQL (via Neon) for primary data storage and ClickHouse for analytics. All database access goes through the `@db/` service via RPC.

### How do services communicate?

Services use **Workers RPC (Service Bindings)** for inter-service communication:
- Type-safe at compile time
- Zero network overhead (same Worker runtime)
- Automatic serialization
- No HTTP overhead

---

## Development

### How do I run .do locally?

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/dot-do/.do.git
cd .do

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start dev servers (all services)
pnpm dev
```

Each service runs on a different port (see README).

### How do I run tests?

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests for specific service
cd workers/gateway
pnpm test

# Run with coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

### How do I deploy to Cloudflare?

```bash
# Deploy specific service
cd workers/gateway
pnpm run deploy

# Deploy all services (from root)
pnpm run deploy:all
```

Make sure you've set up Cloudflare credentials (`wrangler login`).

---

## AI Integration

### How do I use AI features?

```typescript
import { llm } from '@dot-do/llm'

// Generate text
const response = await llm.generate({
  prompt: 'Explain microservices',
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4.5',
})

// Stream responses
const stream = await llm.generateStream({
  prompt: 'Write a story',
  model: 'gpt-4',
})

for await (const chunk of stream) {
  console.log(chunk)
}
```

### Which AI models are supported?

- **OpenAI:** GPT-4, GPT-3.5
- **Anthropic:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus
- **Google:** Gemini Pro, Gemini Flash
- **Open Source:** Mistral, Llama 3

Switch models easily - same API for all.

### How do I create embeddings?

```typescript
import { embeddings } from '@dot-do/embeddings'

const vector = await embeddings.create({
  text: 'Your text here',
  model: 'text-embedding-3-small',
})
```

---

## SDK

### What are the 121 SDK packages?

We provide domain-specific TypeScript SDKs for every industry:
- Healthcare APIs
- Finance APIs
- Retail APIs
- Manufacturing APIs
- Logistics APIs
- ...and 100+ more

Each package is auto-generated from Schema.org + GS1 standards.

### How do I use an SDK package?

```typescript
import { HealthcareApi } from '@dot-do/healthcare'

const api = new HealthcareApi({ apiKey: 'your-key' })
const patient = await api.patients.get('patient-id')
```

### Are SDK packages published to npm?

Selected packages are published. Check [packages.do](https://packages.do) for the full list.

# Getting Started with .do

This guide walks you through setting up .do and building your first API application.

---

## üéØ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- **Node.js 18+** ([download](https://nodejs.org))
- **pnpm 8+** (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- **Git** ([download](https://git-scm.com))
- **Code editor** (VS Code recommended)
- **Cloudflare account** (for deployment, [sign up free](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up))

---

## üì¶ Installation

### Option 1: Use the SDK (Quick Start)

Install the .do SDK in your existing project:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @dot-do/api-client

# Using pnpm
pnpm add @dot-do/api-client

# Using bun
bun add @dot-do/api-client
```

### Option 2: Clone Full Repository

Clone all .do repositories for local development:

```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/dot-do/.do.git
cd .do

# Install all dependencies
pnpm install
```

---

## üöÄ Your First API Call

Create a file `example.ts`:

```typescript
import { ApiClient } from '@dot-do/api-client'

const client = new ApiClient({
  apiKey: process.env.DOT_DO_API_KEY,
})

async function main() {
  // Generate AI content
  const result = await client.ai.generate({
    prompt: 'Explain microservices architecture in simple terms',
    model: 'claude-sonnet-4.5',
  })

  console.log(result.text)
}

main()
```

Run it:

```bash
# Set API key (get one at https://api.do/keys)
export DOT_DO_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Run
tsx example.ts
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è Deploy Your First Microservice

### Step 1: Choose a Service

Start with the **gateway** service (API routing):

```bash
cd workers/gateway
```

### Step 2: Configure Cloudflare

```bash
# Login to Cloudflare
wrangler login

# Verify
wrangler whoami
```

### Step 3: Deploy

```bash
# Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
pnpm run deploy
```

You'll get a URL like: `https://gateway.your-subdomain.workers.dev`

### Step 4: Test

```bash
curl https://gateway.your-subdomain.workers.dev/health
# {"status":"ok"}
```

---

## üß™ Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run specific service tests
cd workers/db
pnpm test

# Run with coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```
