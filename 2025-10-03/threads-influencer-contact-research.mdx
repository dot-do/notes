**Status:** Research-only (no implementation)

---

## Executive Summary

Threads, Meta's Twitter alternative launched in July 2023, has grown to **320+ million monthly active users** by January 2025. The platform offers multiple legitimate methods for contacting influencers, primarily through its newly launched **direct messaging system** (July 2025), **Instagram integration**, and **profile link-in-bio tools**. This report covers legal contact methods, platform features, API access, and compliance considerations for business collaboration purposes.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **Native DMs launched July 2025** - Direct messaging now available on Threads
- ✅ **Official API available** - Limited profile discovery for accounts with 1,000+ followers
- ✅ **Instagram integration** - Username, verification, contact info carry over
- ⚠️ **Rate limits apply** - 1,000 API requests per 24 hours for profile discovery
- ⚠️ **Contact restrictions** - DMs only between followers or mutual Instagram followers (18+)
- ❌ **No email database** - No official contact database; use Instagram business profiles

---

## 1. Where Influencers List Contact Information

### 1.1 Threads Profile Bio Links

**Current Status (2025):**
- Users can add **only one link** to their Threads bio (displayed below bio text)
- **Multiple links feature** is in "very early internal testing" with no public release date
- Link clicks are tracked and visible to profile owners via Threads Insights

**Workarounds:**
- Link-in-bio tools (Linktree, Beacons, etc.) allow one link to lead to multiple destinations
- Many creators use these tools to consolidate contact options and social links

### 1.2 Instagram Integration

**What Carries Over from Instagram to Threads:**
- ✅ **Username** - Automatically synced (can be customized)
- ✅ **Verification badge** - Blue check carries over from Instagram
- ✅ **Profile picture** - Auto-populated from Instagram
- ✅ **Bio** - Initially populated from Instagram (can be customized)
- ✅ **Links** - Bio links carry over
- ✅ **Blocked accounts** - Safety settings transfer

**Instagram Business/Creator Contact Info:**
- Business and Creator accounts can display **email addresses and phone numbers**
- Business accounts can also include **physical location**
- Contact buttons: "Call," "Text," or "Email"
- Settings: Navigate to 'Public business information' → 'Profile display' to toggle visibility

**Important:** While Instagram accounts require login, this contact information is **publicly visible** on business/creator profiles and carries over conceptually to Threads (users often link their Instagram in Threads bio).

### 1.3 Link-in-Bio Tools (2025)

**Popular Tools:**

| Tool | Key Features | Pricing |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Linktree** | Pioneer of link-in-bio category, simple and fast | Free plan (basic), paid plans available |
| **Beacons** | Full creator toolkit: invoicing, media kit, email marketing, store | Free (9% transaction fee), Creator Pro available |
| **Linkin.bio** | Instagram-native solution | Varies |
| **Koji** | Interactive experiences | Varies |

**Beacons vs. Linktree (2025):**
- **Beacons:** More feature-rich for creators (invoices, auto-updating media kit, email marketing)
- **Linktree:** Faster, simpler, dedicated link-in-bio focus
- Both offer free plans suitable for testing

**Impact of Threads' Multi-Link Feature:**
Once Threads allows up to 5 links (like Instagram), reliance on link-in-bio services may decrease, though these tools still offer analytics and design customization.

## 6. Outreach Best Practices

### 6.1 DM Strategies on Threads

**Best Practices for Threads DMs (2025):**

**Before You DM:**
1. **Build rapport first** - Engage with their content (like, comment, share)
2. **Follow them** - DMs work best between followers
3. **Research thoroughly** - Understand their content, audience, values
4. **Check contact preferences** - Some creators list preferred contact methods

**Crafting Your Message:**
1. **Personalize** - Use their name, reference specific content
2. **Be concise** - Keep initial message short (3-5 sentences)
3. **Value-driven** - Explain what's in it for them
4. **Strong opening** - Grab attention in first line
5. **Clear CTA** - What do you want them to do?

**Timing:**
- **Build connection first** - Don't cold DM immediately
- **Check response rates** - Threads DM response data is limited (launched July 2025)
- **Multi-channel approach** - Try Threads, Instagram, email, LinkedIn

**What to Avoid:**
- ❌ Generic copy-paste messages
- ❌ Lengthy pitches in first message
- ❌ Immediate product promotion
- ❌ Multiple messages if no response (spam)
- ❌ Messages to unrelated niches

**Response Rate Expectations:**
- General cold DM response rate: **1-5%**
- With personalization and rapport: **10-36%**
- Lower rates for 100K+ follower accounts
- Better rates for nano-influencers (5K-10K followers)

### 6.2 Instagram vs. Threads Outreach

**When to Use Threads:**
- ✅ Text-based collaboration (thought leadership, discussions)
- ✅ Newer, less saturated platform
- ✅ Creators active on Threads specifically
- ✅ Community-building campaigns
- ✅ B2B influencer marketing (growing on Threads)

**When to Use Instagram:**
- ✅ Visual content collaborations
- ✅ Established creators with mature audiences
- ✅ E-commerce and product-focused campaigns
- ✅ Creators not yet active on Threads
- ✅ Access to business contact information

**Multi-Platform Strategy (Recommended):**
1. Start with social DM (Threads or Instagram)
2. Follow up with email if available
3. Try alternative platform (LinkedIn for B2B, Twitter/X)
4. Respect non-responses (don't spam)

**Comparative Advantages:**

| Feature | Threads | Instagram |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **DMs** | New (July 2025) | Mature, established |
| **Open rates** | TBD (too new) | Higher than email |
| **Competition** | Lower | Higher (saturated) |
| **Contact info** | Limited | Business accounts show email/phone |
| **User base** | 320M MAU | 2B+ MAU |
| **Influencer density** | Growing | Very high |

### 6.3 Response Rate Expectations

**General Benchmarks (2025):**

| Outreach Method | Average Response Rate | Best Case |
|-----------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Cold DM** | 1-5% | 10-36% (with rapport) |
| **Cold Email** | 5-12% | 15-20% |
| **LinkedIn** | 8-15% | 25-30% |
| **Multi-channel** | 15-25% | 40%+ |

**Factors Affecting Response Rates:**

**Positive Factors:**
- ✅ Personalization and research
- ✅ Prior engagement with content
- ✅ Mutual connections or followers
- ✅ Clear value proposition
- ✅ Professional approach
- ✅ Nano/micro influencers (5K-50K followers)

**Negative Factors:**
- ❌ Generic messages
- ❌ Targeting mega-influencers (100K+)
- ❌ No prior relationship
- ❌ Vague or unclear offer
- ❌ Poor timing
- ❌ Unrelated niche

**Threads-Specific Considerations:**
- Platform is newer (July 2023 launch)
- DMs only launched July 2025
- Response rate data not yet established
- Less competition = potentially better rates
- Text-based format may favor authentic connection

**Optimization Tips:**
1. **Start small** - Target 5K-10K follower accounts
2. **Build rapport** - Engage 3-5 times before DMing
3. **Personalize** - Reference specific posts or values
4. **Test messages** - A/B test different approaches
5. **Track metrics** - Monitor response rates and adjust
6. **Multi-channel** - Don't rely on one platform

- [Fortune - Threads Data Limits](https://fortune.com/2023/07/19/threads-meta-twitter-data-limits-scraping-elon-musk/)

### 7.2 Meta Anti-Spam Policies

**Meta's Approach (2025):**

**For Users:**
- Report spam via DM settings

- Set DM preferences (followers only vs. anyone)
- Message requests from non-followers go to separate folder
- Links and media disabled in requests from non-followers

- Require explicit user permissions (`threads_basic`, `threads_profile_discovery`)
- Monitor for automated abuse
- Ban accounts/apps violating Terms of Service

**Community Guidelines:**
Threads follows Instagram's Community Guidelines, which prohibit:

### 7.3 ActivityPub/Fediverse Implications

**What is ActivityPub?**
- Open protocol for decentralized social networks
- Powers Mastodon, PeerTube, and other "Fediverse" platforms
- Allows cross-platform communication

**Threads Integration Status (2025):**

**Timeline:**
- **July 2023:** Threads launches with ActivityPub plans
- **March 2024:** Beta Fediverse support (non-EU users)
- **August 2024:** Fediverse replies visible in Threads
- **2025:** Limited two-way compatibility (still incomplete)

**Current Capabilities:**
- ✅ Threads users can crosspost to ActivityPub
- ✅ Fediverse users can view Threads posts
- ✅ Threads shows number of Fediverse likes
- ✅ Fediverse replies visible in Threads (August 2024+)
- ❌ Full two-way compatibility not yet complete

**Privacy Concerns:**
- Meta retains control of user data even with Fediverse integration
- Cross-platform content sharing raises data visibility questions
- Some Fediverse admins resist federation with Meta ("Fedipact")
- Concerns about "embrace, extend, and extinguish" strategy
- Moderation challenges across federated networks

**Data Access Implications:**
- Public Threads posts may be visible on Fediverse platforms
- Contact information could be exposed to broader network
- ActivityPub protocol has its own data access rules
- Users should understand cross-platform sharing settings

**Community Resistance:**
Many Fediverse server admins have signed "Fedipact" pledging to block federation with Threads over concerns about:
- Meta's business model (user data control)
- Potential to dominate and control decentralized network
- Inadequate moderation for marginalized communities
- Corporate influence on open protocols

- Include unsubscribe link in emails
- Process opt-outs promptly
- Monitor third-party compliance (if using tools)

**Penalties:**
- Up to **$51,744 per violation**
- Criminal penalties for egregious violations

**Social Media Specific Considerations:**

**Instagram/Threads GDPR:**
- Each company responsible for own compliance when advertising
- Facebook pixel requires GDPR consent for retargeting
- Instagram advertisers must gain consent for tracking

**Best Practices:**
1. **Data Collection:** Only collect publicly available information
2. **Consent:** Obtain explicit consent before email marketing
3. **Transparency:** Clearly state why you're contacting them
4. **Storage:** Secure storage, limited retention
5. **Third-Party Tools:** Verify compliance of tools you use
6. **Opt-Out:** Provide easy unsubscribe/opt-out
7. **Documentation:** Keep records of consent and compliance

**Legal Safe Harbors:**
- Publicly available information (profile data)
- Information willingly shared (website contact forms)
- Business contact information (company email addresses)
- Legitimate business interest (B2B outreach)

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Scraping data behind authentication
- ❌ Collecting personal data without consent
- ❌ Buying email lists from unverified sources
- ❌ Ignoring opt-out requests
- ❌ Unclear privacy policies

### 7.5 Web Scraping Legality (2025)

**General Legal Landscape:**

**What's Generally Legal:**
- ✅ Scraping **publicly available data** (no login required)
- ✅ Respecting **robots.txt** directives
- ✅ Maintaining reasonable scraping rate
- ✅ Anonymizing personal data (GDPR compliance)
- ✅ Using data for legitimate purposes

**What's Generally Illegal/Risky:**
- ❌ Scraping data **behind authentication** walls
- ❌ Violating **Terms of Service** (can lead to bans)
- ❌ Circumventing **anti-scraping measures**
- ❌ Collecting **personal data** without consent (GDPR)
- ❌ Using deceptive practices (cloaking, spoofing)
- ❌ Placing excessive load on servers

**Key Legal Precedents (2025):**

**LinkedIn vs. hiQ Labs:**
- hiQ scraped publicly accessible LinkedIn profiles
- LinkedIn tried to block under Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)
- **Court sided with hiQ:** Scraping public data ≠ unauthorized access
- Established precedent for public data scraping

**Meta vs. Bright Data (2024):**
- Meta sued Bright Data for scraping Facebook/Instagram
- U.S. Federal Court **favored Bright Data**
- No evidence of scraping behind login walls
- **Reinforced:** Public data scraping generally permissible

**Ethical Considerations:**

Even if legal, consider ethics:
- **Privacy rights** - Is this data meant to be bulk-collected?
- **Data security** - How will you protect scraped data?
- **Transparency** - Would users expect this use?
- **Anonymization** - Can you remove PII?
- **Purpose** - Is there a legitimate business reason?

**Best Practices for Legal Scraping:**

1. **Respect robots.txt** - Honor site directives
2. **Check Terms of Service** - Understand prohibited activities
3. **Public data only** - Don't scrape behind logins
4. **Rate limiting** - Don't overload servers
5. **Anonymize PII** - Remove names, emails, phone numbers
6. **Clear purpose** - Legitimate business use only
7. **Transparent practices** - Be honest about data collection
8. **Legal review** - Consult attorney for large-scale projects

**Threads-Specific Considerations:**

**Threads ToS Position:**
"Users are prohibited from crawling, scraping, or spidering any page, data, or portion of or relating to Threads."

**Practical Reality:**
- Public threads.net pages are accessible without login
- Court precedents favor public data scraping
- But: Violating ToS can result in account termination
- Risk: Meta could pursue legal action (though rare for small-scale)

**Recommendation:**
- **Prefer official API** (legal, supported, rate-limited)
- **Use scraping as last resort** (understand risks)
- **Consult legal counsel** (for large-scale projects)
- **Focus on public, non-PII data** (lower risk)
- **Be transparent** (if possible, notify data subjects)

## Conclusion

Threads offers legitimate opportunities for influencer collaboration through multiple contact methods. The platform's July 2025 DM launch makes direct outreach possible, while Instagram integration provides additional contact pathways. Success requires authentic engagement, multi-channel strategies, and strict legal compliance.

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Build rapport before pitching** - Engage authentically first
2. **Use multi-channel approach** - Threads DM + Instagram + Email
3. **Start with nano/micro-influencers** - Better response rates
4. **Personalize every message** - Research thoroughly
5. **Comply with all laws** - GDPR, CAN-SPAM, platform ToS
6. **Leverage Instagram integration** - Find contact info on IG business accounts
7. **Use official tools** - API over scraping
8. **Track and optimize** - Measure response rates, iterate

**Current State (October 2025):**
- 320M+ monthly active users
- Native DM feature launched (July 2025)
- Official API available (1,000+ follower requirement)
- Growing but not yet saturated (opportunity window)
- Strong Instagram integration (contact info carryover)

**Bottom Line:** Threads presents a **significant opportunity** for early adopters. With lower competition than Instagram and authentic, text-based connections, brands and agencies can build influencer relationships NOW before the platform becomes saturated. Focus on compliant, authentic outreach using multiple channels, and prioritize relationship-building over transactional pitches.
