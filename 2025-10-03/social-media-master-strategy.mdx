## 5. Content Strategy Framework

### Weekly Content Distribution Model

| Day | Platform 1 | Platform 2 | Platform 3 | Platform 4 |
|-----|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|

- **Medium effort (3-5 hrs/week):** Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest
- **Low effort (1-3 hrs/week):** TikTok, Twitter/X, Threads

### Content Repurposing Strategy

**Core Content Creation → Multi-Platform Adaptation:**

**Step 1: Create Pillar Content**
- Long-form video (YouTube) - 8-15 minutes
- In-depth article/post (LinkedIn/Medium)
- Comprehensive guide (Pinterest carousel)

**Step 2: Break Down into Platform-Specific Formats**

From **1 YouTube video** (8-15 min):
- **TikTok/Instagram Reels:** 3-5 clips (15-60 sec each) - Best moments
- **YouTube Shorts:** 5-7 clips (20-60 sec) - Hooks and payoffs
- **Twitter/X:** 5-7 text threads - Key takeaways with images
- **LinkedIn:** Carousel post - Framework/process from video
- **Facebook:** Native video clip (2-3 min) - Most valuable segment
- **Pinterest:** Infographic pins - Stats and insights
- **Threads:** 3-5 discussion posts - Ask questions from video topics
- **Instagram Stories:** Behind-the-scenes of video creation
- **Reddit:** Text post - In-depth answer to question video addresses

**Content Multiplication:**
- 1 pillar piece → 25-30 platform-specific posts
- 1 hour of core content creation → 8-10 hours of distributed content
- **ROI:** ~1:8 time efficiency ratio

### Platform-Specific Adaptation Rules

**DON'T Just Copy-Paste—Adapt for Each Platform:**

**Original LinkedIn Post (Educational):**
"Here are 5 ways to improve your marketing ROI in 2025..." (300 words)

**Adaptations:**
- **Instagram:** Carousel with 1 tip per slide + visuals
- **TikTok:** 60-sec video showing tips with b-roll

- **Threads:** Discussion post - "What's YOUR #1 ROI strategy?"

**Key Adaptation Principles:**
1. **Format for platform** (vertical video vs. text vs. carousel)
2. **Adjust length** (8-min YouTube vs. 60-sec TikTok)
3. **Match tone** (professional LinkedIn vs. casual Threads)
4. **Native hosting** (upload to platform, don't link out)
