# Worker Deployment Status - 2025-10-05

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ Working Workers (2/16)

1. **db.drivly.workers.dev** - WORKING
   - Returns JSON data (blog posts directory)
   - No errors
   - Production ready

2. **blog.drivly.workers.dev** - WORKING
   - Returns: `{"service":"blog-stream","version":"1.0.0","status":"ready"}`
   - No errors
   - Production ready

### ‚ùå Failing Workers (3/16 tested)

1. **generate.drivly.workers.dev** - FAILING
   - Error: "Internal Server Error"
   - Likely cause: Missing API keys (OPENROUTER_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY)
   - Code tries to initialize AI providers without env vars

2. **gateway.drivly.workers.dev** - FAILING
   - Error: `{"error":"Not found","message":"No service found for path: /"}`
   - Likely cause: Gateway routing logic expecting specific paths/domains
   - May need DNS configuration

3. **api.drivly.workers.dev** - FAILING
   - Error: "Internal Server Error"
   - Likely cause: Missing service bindings or env vars

### üîç Not Yet Tested (11/16)

- auth, schedule, webhooks, email, queue, mcp
- voice, podcast, numerics, app, site

## Recommendation

The real issue is missing environment variables, not infrastructure provisioning.
Focus on setting required env vars for each worker first.
